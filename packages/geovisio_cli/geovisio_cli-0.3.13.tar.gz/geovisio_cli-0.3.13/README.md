__GeoVisio__ is a complete solution for storing and __serving your own 📍📷 geolocated pictures__ (like [StreetView](https://www.google.com/streetview/) / [Mapillary](https://mapillary.com/)).

➡️ __Give it a try__ at [panoramax.ign.fr](https://panoramax.ign.fr/) or [panoramax.openstreetmap.fr](https://panoramax.openstreetmap.fr)!

## 📦 Components

GeoVisio is __modular__ and made out of several components, each of them standardized and ♻️ replaceable.

![GeoVisio architecture](https://gitlab.com/geovisio/api/-/raw/develop/images/big_picture.png)

All of them are 📖 __open-source__ and available online:

# ⌨️ GeoVisio Command-line scripts

This repository contains only the __command-line interface (CLI)__.

## Features

This tool allows you to:

- Upload a sequence of pictures with the GeoVisio API

It is under __development__; new features will appear in the near future 😉


## Install

GeoVisio CLI can be installed using two methods:

- From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/geovisio_cli/), the Python central package repository
- From packaged binaries, availaible in the [latest release page](https://gitlab.com/geovisio/cli/-/releases/)
- Using this [Git repository](https://gitlab.com/geovisio/cli)

Geovisio CLI is compatible with all Python versions >= 3.8.

### From PyPI

Just run this command:

```bash
pip install geovisio_cli
```

You should then be able to use the CLI tool with the name `geovisio`:

```bash
geovisio --help
```

Alternatively, you can use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) if you want all the script dependencies to be in a custom virtual env.

If you choose to [install pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/), then run:

```bash
pipx install geovisio_cli
```

### From packaged binaries

Packaged binaries are available for Windows and Linux on AMD64 architecture. The binaries include python and all necessary dependencies, so they should be self-sufficient.

They are available from the [latest release](https://gitlab.com/geovisio/cli/-/releases).

### Linux

Prebuild binary have been built for AMD64. They are built using Ubuntu 22.04, so they should work for all newer version. For older version though, there might be libstdc++ incompatibilities; if you encounter that problem, you can update libstdc++ or directly use Pypi.

Download the binary, then in the download directory:
```bash
chmod u+x geovisio_cli-linux-amd64
./geovisio_cli-linux-amd64 --help
```

Optional, you can put this in /usr/local/bin (if it's in your path):
```bash
chmod u+x geovisio_cli-linux-amd64
mv geovisio_cli-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/geovisio_cli

geovisio_cli --help
```

Note: on Linux, it might be easier to directly use the pypi package, combined with `pipx`.  Updates will be easier and there should be less problems with library versions.

#### Windows

On Windows, just download the Windows executable and open a shell in the download directory (you can do that by typing `cmd` in the explorer opened in the directory).

Then, simply run: 
```powershell
geovisio_cli-win-amd64.exe --help
```

### From Git repository

Download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/geovisio/cli.git geovisio_cli
cd geovisio_cli/
```

To avoid conflicts, it's considered a good practice to create a _[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)_ (or virtualenv). To do so, launch the following commands:

```bash
# Create the virtual environment in a folder named "env"
python3 -m venv env

# Launches utilities to make environment available in your Bash
source ./env/bin/activate
```

Then, install the GeoVisio CLI dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

You can also install the `dev` dependencies if necessary (to have lints, format, tests, ...):

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Then, you can use the `geovisio` command:
```bash
geovisio --help
```


## Usage

All details of available commands are listed in the [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) documentation.

### Upload pictures

The picture upload command is available under the `upload` subcommand:

```bash
geovisio upload --help
```

If you want to upload pictures from a `my_sequence` directory to a GeoVisio instance (running locally in this example), launch this command:

```bash
geovisio upload --api-url http://localhost:5000/ ./my_sequence
```

You can also add a `--wait` flag to wait for geovisio to process all the pictures.

Note that you can launch again the same command to recover a partial sequence import, for example if only some pictures failed to upload.

#### Authentication

If the GeoVisio API requires a login for the upload, the `upload` command will ask for a login on the instance by visiting a given url with a browser. 

You can also login before hand with the command:

```bash
geovisio login --api-url http://localhost:5000/
```

Both will store the credentials in a configuration file, located either in a [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) defined directory or in a user specific .config, in a subdirectory `geovisio/config.toml`.

If you do not want to use this, you can also provide a geovisio token with the `--token` parameter.

### External metadata

Picture metadata can also be set using a CSV file. This file should be placed in the same directory as pictures, and can be named as you like, as long as it ends with `.csv`. You can name it `_geovisio.csv` for example.

The CSV file should contain all following columns:

Header | Type  | Mandatory ? | Description
-------|-------|-------------|-----------
file   | str   | Yes         | File name of the picture
lon    | float | No          | WGS84 longitude (for example 55.56 for Réunion Island)
lat    | float | No          | WGS84 latitude (for example -21.14 for Réunion Island)
capture_time|str| No         | Capture time of the picture, in [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) (like `1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z`). If no timezone is given, considered as local time (and thus the date + position would be used to localize it).
Exif.* | str   | No          | Any EXIF tag, with column name following [Exiv2](https://exiv2.org/metadata.html) scheme (example Exif.Image.Artist). You can create as many columns as necessary.
Xmp.*  | str   | No          | Any XMP tag, with column name following [Exiv2](https://exiv2.org/metadata.html) scheme (example Xmp.digiKam.TagsList). You can create as many columns as necessary.

All metadatas defined in the CSV are optional. If a metadata is not defined in CSV for a given image, GeoVisio CLI will try to read it from picture EXIF metadata.

__Note that__ GeoVisio API [will always need some metadata to be present](https://gitlab.com/geovisio/api/-/blob/develop/docs/15_Pictures_requirements.md) (the GPS coordinates and the capture time), no matter where they are read from.

### Collection status

Prints the status of a collection.

```bash
geovisio collection-status --id <some collection id> --api-url http://localhost:5000
```

You can alternatively give the location of the sequence (its full url) like:

```bash
geovisio collection-status --location http://localhost:5000/api/collections/dae288b2-9e8d-4896-af39-d35ce6bc9d4e
```

You can also add a `--wait` flag to wait for geovisio to process all the pictures.

## Development

### Tests

Tests are run using PyTest. By default, our tests use a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environment (located in `./tests/integration/docker-compose-geovisio.yml`) to set-up a temporary GeoVisio API to run onto. If you have Docker Compose enabled and running on your machine, you can simply run this command to launch tests:

```bash
pytest
```

If you don't have Docker Compose, or want to use an existing GeoVisio test instance (to speed up tests), you can pass the `--external-geovisio-url` option to pytest:

```bash
pytest --external-geovisio-url=http://localhost:5000
```

#### Using with an unsecure geovisio API

The CLI parameter `--disable-cert-check` is available to use with an unsecure geovisio API (or when behind proxies messing with ssl). 

There are no automated test for this, but you can run a geovisio with `flask run --cert=adhoc` to manually test this. 

### Documentation

High-level documentation is handled by [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/). You can update the generated `USAGE.md` file using this command:

```bash
make docs
```

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Note that before opening a pull requests, you may want to check formatting and tests of your changes:

```bash
make ci
```

You can also install git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to format code on commit with:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

### Make a release

```bash
git checkout main
git pull

make docs ci
vim CHANGELOG.md							# Edit version + links at bottom
vim geovisio_cli/__init__.py	# Edit version

git add *
git commit -m "Release x.x.x"
git tag -a x.x.x -m "Release x.x.x"
git push origin main --tags
```
