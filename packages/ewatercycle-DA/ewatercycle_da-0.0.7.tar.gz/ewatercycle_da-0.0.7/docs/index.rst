Welcome to eWaterCycle-DataAssimilation's documentation!
========================================================

**eWaterCycle-DA** is a python package which adds data assimilation functionality to the `eWaterCycle <https://ewatercycle.nl/>`_ platform.

More info to be added...


There are two ways in this package of running data assimilation. The easiest & most user friendly is method 1 where you define the parameters used in DA upfront.

The more advanced, but more powerful is method 2 where you define the parameters used in DA as you go. You can run the model, then decide to assimilate on the go.

The added benefit of this model structure is that the package can also be used for ensembles which don't assimilate, like a collection of model comparisons:
