Transforms
==========

.. |Transform| replace:: ``Transform``

Mpltern is implemented as a new
`projection <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/projections_api.html>`__
of Matplotlib by implementing several new |Transform|_ classes for ternary
plots.
This allows us to auto-position tick markers, tick labels, and axis labels with
reasonable paddings consistent with Matplotlib.

The examples below show how to use such |Transform|_ classes in mpltern.
