**bootstrap styles integration** for for `YAFOWIL <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yafowil>`_
- Yet Another Form Widget Library.

This package provides themes for Bootstrap 3, 4 and 5.

In order to select one of the bootstrap versions, ``configure_factory`` must be
called with the desired theme name:

.. code-block:: python

    from yafowil.bootstrap import configure_factory

    # bootstap3, bootstrap4, bootstrap5
    configure_factory('bootstrap5')

Included Bootstrap distributions:

* Bootstrap 3.4.1
* Bootstrap 4.6.0
* Bootstrap 5.1.0

``yafowil.bootstrap`` 2.0 is a transitional version. in 3.0 the bootstrap
distributions will be removed as resource delivery is planned to be changed
to ``webresource``.

2.0.0a1 (2023-05-15)

- Factory configuration and macro registration is no longer done automatically
  due to the multi-theme feature. It must be configured in your code using
  ``yafowil.bootstrap``. In order to do so do
  ``from yafowil.bootstrap import configure_factory``. Next call it with the
  name of the desired theme ``configure_factory('bootstrap3')``.
  [jensens]

- Add support for Bootstrap 4 and 5 using theme ``bootstrap[4|5]``.
  The Bootstrap 3 theme is still available as ``bootstrap3``.
  Latter provides a legacy fallback as ``bootstrap`` which will be removed in
