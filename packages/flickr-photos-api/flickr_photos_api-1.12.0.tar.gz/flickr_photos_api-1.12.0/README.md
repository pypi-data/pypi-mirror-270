# flickr-photos-api

This is a library for getting information about photos from the Flickr API.

It's not a general-purpose Flickr API library.
It's designed for use at the [Flickr Foundation], and provides a subset of Flickr API methods with the following goals:

*   Abstract away some of the details of the Flickr API -- for example, licenses are returned as complete dictionaries, rather than as the numeric license IDs returned by Flickr API methods.

*   Apply types to all results, so the Flickr API can be used safely in a typed context.

## Examples

```console
>>> from flickr_photos_api import FlickrPhotosApi
>>> api = FlickrPhotosApi(api_key="…", user_agent="…")

>>> photo = api.get_single_photo(photo_id="14898030836")

>>> photo
{'id': '14898030836', 'title': 'NASA Scientists Says', …}

>>> photo["license"]
{'id': 'cc-by-2.0', 'label': 'CC BY 2.0', 'url': 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/'}

>>> photo["url"]
'https://www.flickr.com/photos/lassennps/14898030836/'
```

## Usage

1.  Install flickr-photos-api from PyPI:

    ```console
    $ pip install flickr-photos-api
    ```

2.  Construct an instance of `FlickrPhotosApi`.
    You need to pass a user-agent that identifies you, and a [Flickr API key][key].

    ```python
    from flickr_photos_api import FlickrPhotosApi

    api = FlickrPhotosApi(api_key="…", user_agent="…")
    ```

3.  Call methods on FlickrPhotosApi.
    The methods meant for public use are:

    ```python
    def get_single_photo(photo_id: str) -> SinglePhoto: ...

    def get_photos_in_album(user_url: str, album_id: str) -> PhotosInAlbum: ...

    def get_photos_in_gallery(gallery_id: str) -> PhotosInGallery: ...

    def get_public_photos_by_user(user_url: str) -> CollectionOfPhotos: ...

    def get_photos_in_group_pool(group_url: str) -> PhotosInGroup: ...

    def get_photos_with_tag(tag: str) -> CollectionOfPhotos: ...
    ```

    Methods that return collections of photos also support `page` and `per_page` parameters to control pagination.
