    """
    Resolve the dependencies and return the `RepoDataRecord`s
    that should be present in the environment.

    Arguments:
        specs: A list of matchspec to solve.
        available_packages: A list of RepoData to use for solving the `specs`.
        locked_packages: Records of packages that are previously selected.
                         If the solver encounters multiple variants of a single
                         package (identified by its name), it will sort the records
                         and select the best possible version. However, if there
                         exists a locked version it will prefer that variant instead.
                         This is useful to reduce the number of packages that are
                         updated when installing new packages. Usually you add the
                         currently installed packages or packages from a lock-file here.
        pinned_packages: Records of packages that are previously selected and CANNOT
                         be changed. If the solver encounters multiple variants of
                         a single package (identified by its name), it will sort the
                         records and select the best possible version. However, if
                         there is a variant available in the `pinned_packages` field it
                         will always select that version no matter what even if that
                         means other packages have to be downgraded.
        virtual_packages: A list of virtual packages considered active.
        channel_priority: (Default = ChannelPriority.Strict) When `ChannelPriority.Strict`
                         the channel that the package is first found in will be used as
                         the only channel for that package. When `ChannelPriority.Disabled`
                         it will search for every package in every channel.

    Returns:
        Resolved list of `RepoDataRecord`s.
