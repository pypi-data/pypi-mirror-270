METHODS: This was an open-label,  single-center, single-dose, randomized, 4-period crossover study. Following a  21-day screening period, 32 healthy male or female subjects (ages 18 - 45 years)  were randomized to 1 of 4 aliskiren dosing sequence groups (8 subjects per  group): 75, 150, 300 and 600 mg. Blood samples were obtained for determination of  plasma aliskiren concentrations (HPLC/MS/MS) for 96 h post dose. Log-transformed  pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and C(max) were analyzed to determine  dose-proportionality using the power model, parameter = A*(Dose)(beta), where A =  intercept and beta = dose-proportionality coefficient. The predefined  dose-proportionality criteria over the dose range 75 â 600 mg were 90% confidence  intervals (CI) for beta contained within the range 0.89 - 1.11. RESULTS: AUC and  Cmax values increased with increasing doses of aliskiren. Both AUC and C(max)  were associated with high variability (coefficient of variation 55 - 64% for AUC  and 59 - 117% for C(max)). The estimated proportionality coefficients (beta) for  AUC(0-infiniti), AUC(0-t) and C(max) were 1.18 (90% CI 1.10, 1.25), 1.29 (90% CI  1.22, 1.36) and 1.42 (90% CI 1.31, 1.52), respectively. Dose-proportionality was,  therefore, not demonstrated across the entire 8-fold dose range. For the clinical  dose range of 150 â 300 mg, increases of 2.3- and 2.6-fold were observed for AUC  and C(max), respectively. All doses of aliskiren were well tolerated.  CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to aliskiren was greater than proportional over the dose  range of 75 - 600 mg. Over the therapeutic dose range of 150 â 300 mg approved  for the treatment of hypertension, AUC and Cmax increased by 2.3- and 2.6-fold,  respectively. The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren show relatively high intersubject  variability.","2008-05","2024-04-17 08:25:38","2024-04-17 08:34:47","","252-258","","5","46","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 18538111","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Mass Spectrometry; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors; Antihypertensive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Amides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Fumarates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim was to examine the possible effects  of the SLCO2B1 c.935G>A SNP on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the suggested  OATP2B1 substrates montelukast and aliskiren. METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers  with the SLCO2B1 c.935GG genotype, 12 with the c.935GA genotype, and five with  the c.935AA genotype ingested a single 10 mg dose of montelukast or a 150 mg dose  of aliskiren, with a washout period of 1 week.

The absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion of [(14)C]aliskiren were investigated in  four healthy male subjects after administration of a single 300-mg oral dose in  an aqueous solution. Plasma radioactivity and aliskiren concentration  measurements and complete urine and feces collections were made for 168 h  postdose. Peak plasma levels of aliskiren (C(max)) were achieved between 2 and 5  h postdose. Unchanged aliskiren represented the principal circulating species in  plasma, accounting for 81% of total plasma radioactivity (AUC(0-infinity)), and  indicating very low exposure to metabolites. Terminal half-lives for  radioactivity and aliskiren in plasma were 49 h and 44 h, respectively. Dose  recovery over 168 h was nearly complete (91.5% of dose); excretion occurred  almost completely via the fecal route (90.9%), with only 0.6% recovered in the  urine. Unabsorbed drug accounted for a large dose proportion recovered in feces  in unchanged form. Based on results from this and from previous studies, the  absorbed fraction of aliskiren can be estimated to approximately 5% of dose. The  absorbed dose was partly eliminated unchanged via the hepatobiliary route.  Oxidized metabolites in excreta accounted for at least 1.3% of the radioactive  dose.

This study investigated the  interaction profile of aliskiren, which is of clinical importance because  hypertensive patients often require concomitant drug therapy for associated  comorbidities. METHODS: Four separate studies investigated the pharmacokinetic  interaction between single oral doses of aliskiren and lovastatin, atenolol,  celecoxib or cimetidine, respectively. All studies involved healthy male  volunteers aged 18-45 years. In 3 studies, subjects (n = 15 in each study)  received single doses of aliskiren 150 mg alone, the test drug alone (lovastatin  40 mg, atenolol 100 mg or celecoxib 200 mg), or both drugs in combination,  according to a 3-period crossover design. In the cimetidine study (n = 12),  aliskiren 150 mg was administered alone or concomitantly with cimetidine 800 mg  according to a two-period crossover design. Plasma concentrations of aliskiren  and test drugs were determined by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry  methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from these data. RESULTS: Mean  AUC and t1/2 for aliskiren were not significantly changed by lovastatin, atenolol  or celecoxib (< 10% difference between treatments). Aliskiren mean Cmax was not  affected by either lovastatin or atenolol, although a non-significant 36%  increase was observed with celecoxib. Modest, non-significant increases in  aliskiren systemic availability followed coadministration with cimetidine  (aliskiren mean AUC, Cmax and t1/2 increased by 17%, 19% and 15%, respectively).  Aliskiren coadministration had no significant effect on the disposition of  lovastatin, atenolol or celecoxib.

If the drug properties grant sufficient penetration of the drug from  blood into saliva, the latter is a useful matrix for noninvasive investigations.  Concerning the known physicochemical properties, the direct renin inhibitor  aliskiren is one of the substances of which saliva concentrations could  substitute blood concentrations for pharmacokinetic investigations in children.  Therefore, a reliable bioanalytical method was successfully developed and  validated according to the criteria of current international bioanalytical  guidelines to enable the comparison of blood and saliva concentrations of  aliskiren. After purification of the fluid by solid-phase extraction the  chromatographic separation was conducted by using Xselect™ C18 CSH columns.  Applying a mobile phase gradient of acidified methanol and acidified water at a  flow rate of 0.4ml/min the column effluent was monitored during a total run time  of 7.5min by tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. Running in  positive mode the following transitions were investigated: 552.2-436.2m/z for  aliskiren and 425.3-351.2m/z for benazepril (internal standard). Calibration  curves were constructed in the range of 0.586-1200ng/ml and were analyzed  utilizing 1/x(2) weighted linear regression. Intra-run and inter-run precision  were 3.8-8.1% and 3.4-8.9%. The method provides selectivity, linearity and  accuracy. The validated method was then applied to determine aliskiren  concentrations in saliva and blood of three healthy volunteers after oral  administration of 300mg aliskiren.","2014-08-05","2024-04-17 08:25:38","2024-04-17 08:34:31","","118-126","","","96","","J Pharm Biomed Anal","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One drug that emerged from this effort is  aliskiren, a direct human renin inhibitor that blocks the conversion of  angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). In contrast to other antihypertensive  agents, aliskiren decreases plasma renin activity (PRA). In healthy human  subjects, doses of between 40 and 640 mg of aliskiren exert a dose-dependent  reduction in PRA and Ang I and Ang II levels. The bioavailability of aliskiren is  low (2%), peak plasma concentrations are reached within one to three hours and  the binding with plasma proteins achieves approximately 47-51%. Aliskiren is  slightly metabolized (20%) by CYP3A4. The most common adverse events include  diarrhea, headache, back pain and gastrointestinal disorders. Aliskiren is well  tolerated, and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive  agents. Aliskiren belongs to a new class of agents that effectively and  specifically inhibit the RAS. This drug functions through a novel mechanism of  action and has the potential to become a true alternative to angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the therapy of  hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal disorders.","2008-10","2024-04-17 08:25:38","2024-04-17 08:34:29","","623-631","","5","60","","Pharmacol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 19066408","","","","Humans; Animals; Drug Interactions; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Hypertension/drug therapy; Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood; Amides/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Fumarates/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The BP-lowering effects of the renin inhibitor aliskiren are  sustained 3-4 weeks after withdrawal. In this study, the reversibility of the  renal hemodynamic effects of aliskiren was tested. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS,  & MEASUREMENTS: In this open-label study, renal perfusion was measured by 1.5-T  magnetic resonance imaging-arterial spin labeling in 34 subjects with arterial  hypertension before aliskiren (pre-aliskiren), after 4 weeks of aliskiren  treatment (300 mg), and 4-5 days (∼2.5-3.0× plasma half-life) after withdrawal  (post-aliskiren). RESULTS: Aliskiren reduced systolic BP from 152 ± 14 to 139 ±  16 mmHg (P<0.0001), which was sustained post-aliskiren (136 ± 13 mmHg, P=1.00  versus aliskiren). Aliskiren significantly altered renal perfusion (P=0.005),  increasing from 272 ± 25 pre-aliskiren to 287 ± 29 ml/min per 100 g during  aliskiren (P=0.03). This increase in renal perfusion was completely reversed  post-aliskiren (272 ± 26 ml/min per 100 g, P=0.03 versus aliskiren, P=0.63 versus  pre-aliskiren). No changes were noted in urinary angiotensinogen levels. Plasma  renin activity was reduced by aliskiren, which was sustained post-aliskiren.  Angiotensin II and aldosterone were reduced by aliskiren but recovered  post-aliskiren to pre-aliskiren levels. CONCLUSIONS: After withdrawal of  aliskiren, the effects on BP were sustained, whereas increase in renal perfusion  was reversed, which was associated with recovery of angiotensin II and  aldosterone to pretreatment levels.

We investigated whether a renin inhibitor may  neutralize this counterregulation and amplify the effects of AT1 receptor  antagonists. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In 12 normotensive  male individuals who were on a high-sodium diet, a double-blind,  placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design was used to study the hormonal  and BP effects of single oral administrations of 300 mg of the renin inhibitor  aliskiren, 320 mg of valsartan, and a combination of these two drugs, each at  half dosage (150 mg of aliskiren and 160 mg of valsartan). RESULTS: Valsartan  (320 mg) increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I and angiotensin II  levels, but 300 mg of aliskiren decreased them for 48 h. Aliskiren (300 mg)  stimulated immunoreactive renin release more strongly than 320 mg of valsartan,  decreased urinary aldosterone excretion for longer than 320 mg of valsartan, and  had a similar BP-lowering effect as 320 mg of valsartan. In combination, 150 mg  of aliskiren neutralized the valsartan (160 mg)-induced increase in plasma  angiotensins for 48 h. The renin and aldosterone effects of the combination of  150 mg of aliskiren and 160 mg of valsartan were similar to those of 300 mg of  aliskiren and greater than those of 320 mg of valsartan. When plasma drug  concentrations were taken into account, the combination of 150 mg of aliskiren  and 160 mg of valsartan had a synergistic effect on renin release. The  BP-lowering effect of 150 mg of aliskiren and 160 mg of valsartan was similar to  that of 300 mg of aliskiren and 320 mg of valsartan at peak but was more  prolonged. CONCLUSION: The stronger and longer lasting effects on plasma active  renin and urinary aldosterone of aliskiren, alone or in combination, demonstrate  a more effective blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than that obtained with  320 mg of valsartan alone.","2007-09","2024-04-17 08:25:38","2024-04-17 08:34:25","","947-955","","5","2","","Clin J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17702736","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Double-Blind Method; Cross-Over Studies; Valsartan; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Drug Therapy, Combination; Sodium/*metabolism; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors; Amides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Fumarates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Tetrazoles/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Valine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Study 1, aliskiren  was administered orally to juvenile rats at doses of 0, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day  with repeated dosing from postpartum day (PPD) 8 to PPD 35/36. In-life, clinical  pathology, anatomic pathology, and toxicokinetics evaluations were performed. In  Study 2, single oral doses of aliskiren (0, 100 or 300 mg/kg) were given to 14-,  21-, 24-, 28-, 31- or 36-day-old rats; in-life data and toxicokinetics were  evaluated. Study 3 was a single dose (3 mg/kg i.v.) pharmacokinetic study in  juvenile rats on PPD 8, 14, 21 and 28. In Study 4, naïve rats were used to  investigate ontogenic changes of the multidrug-resistant protein 1 (MDR1) and the  organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) mRNA in several organs. Oral  administration of aliskiren at 100 and 300 mg/kg caused unexpected mortality and  severe morbidity in 8-day-old rats. Aliskiren plasma and tissue concentrations  were increased in rats aged 21days and younger. Expression of MDR1 and OATP mRNA  in the intestine, liver and brain was significantly lower in very young rats. In  conclusion, severe toxicity and increased exposure in very young rats after oral  administration of aliskiren are considered to be the result of immature drug  transporter systems. Immaturity of MDR1 in enterocytes appears to be the most  important mechanism responsible for the high exposure.","2014-02-15","2024-04-17 08:25:38","2024-04-17 08:34:38","","36-43","","1","275","","Toxicol Appl Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Aliskiren provides  prolonged blood pressure-lowering effects following treatment discontinuation in  patients. Therefore, we investigated whether aliskiren attains tissue  concentrations sufficient to inhibit local renin-angiotensin system (RAS)  activity in patients. METHODS: We included 10 hypertensive patients with  abdominal adiposity in an open-label study. Following 1-2 weeks washout, patients  received 2 weeks placebo, then 4 weeks aliskiren 300 mg once daily, followed by 4  weeks washout, and then 4 weeks amlodipine 5 mg once daily. Drug concentrations  and RAS biomarkers were measured in interstitial fluid using microdialysis and in  biopsies from abdominal subcutaneous adipose and skeletal muscle. RESULTS: We  detected aliskiren in all compartments. After 4 weeks of treatment,  microdialysate aliskiren concentrations (ng/ml) were 2.4 ± 2.1 (adipose) and  7.1 ± 4.2 (skeletal muscle), similar to plasma concentrations (8.4 ± 4.4); tissue  concentrations (ng/g) were 29.0 ± 16.7 (adipose) and 107.3 ± 68.6 (skeletal  muscle). Eight weeks after discontinuation, aliskiren was measurable in tissue  biopsies but not in plasma or in interstitial fluid. Pooled microdialysate  samples from two sets of four patients suggested reduction in tissue angiotensin  II with aliskiren but not with amlodipine. CONCLUSION: In obese hypertensive  patients, aliskiren penetrates adipose and skeletal muscle tissue at levels that  are apparently sufficient to reduce tissue RAS activity. Furthermore, tissue  binding may contribute to aliskiren's prolonged blood pressure-lowering effect  following discontinuation.","2012-03","2024-04-17 08:25:38","2024-04-17 08:34:27","","561-566","","3","30","","J Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 22278138","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics; Obesity/complications; Adipose Tissue/*metabolism; Extracellular Fluid/metabolism; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy; Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Amlodipine/pharmacokinetics; Amides/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Fumarates/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical observation has identified curcumin as a promising  candidate for in vivo selective BCRP inhibition, in addition to several well  known inhibitors, such as lapatinib and pantoprazole. This study aimed to confirm  the inhibitory efficacy of curcumin on gastrointestinal BCRP function in  cynomolgus monkeys and to perform comparisons with lapatinib and pantoprazole.  Oral area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and bioavailability of  well known BCRP (sulfasalazine and rosuvastatin), P-glycoprotein (fexofenadine,  aliskiren, and talinolol), and CYP3A (midazolam) substrates were investigated in  the presence and absence of inhibitors. Oral exposures of sulfasalazine and  rosuvastatin were markedly elevated by curcumin with minimal changes in systemic  clearance, whereas pharmacokinetic alterations after fexofenadine, aliskiren, and  talinolol oral exposure were limited. Curcumin increased oral midazolam exposure  without affecting systemic clearance, presumably owing to partial inhibition of  intestinal CYP3A. Lapatinib increased the oral AUC for sulfasalazine to a greater  extent than curcumin did, whereas pantoprazole had a smaller effect. However,  lapatinib also exerted significant effects on fexofenadine, failed to selectively  discriminate between BCRP and P-glycoprotein inhibition, and had an effect on  oral midazolam exposure comparable with that of curcumin. Thus, pharmacokinetic  evaluation in monkeys demonstrated that pretreatment with curcumin as an in vivo  selective BCRP inhibitor was more appropriate than pretreatment with lapatinib  and pantoprazole for the assessment of the impact of BCRP on gastrointestinal  absorption in nonrodent models.","2018-05","2024-04-17 08:25:38","2024-04-17 08:34:44","","667-679","","5","46","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29358184","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Biological Availability; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism; Pantoprazole; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Caco-2 Cells; Intestines/drug effects; Macaca fascicularis; 2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles/pharmacology; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/*metabolism; Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism; Curcumin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Lapatinib; Midazolam/pharmacology; Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism; Quinazolines/pharmacology; Rosuvastatin Calcium/pharmacology; Sulfasalazine/pharmacology; Terfenadine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This indicated that  the peptidomimetic approach to the development of antihypertensive agents was  improper. Real non-peptide drug candidates were then expected to provide the  necessary framework for obtaining the desired properties. For this purpose a  homology model of the enzyme was used to characterize the binding mode of  CGP38560 in complex with the renin model and served as a basis for the four  chemistry laboratories that were assigned to this project. The renin team worked  in a full structure-based perspective with this model, and four  chemically-unrelated non-peptide series were discovered acting as renin  inhibitors at the 1-3 nanomolar level. One of these leads was selected for  further development and led to Aliskiren, which has been just approved by the  FDA.

Certain  agents that modify the RAAS can control blood pressure and improve cardiovascular  outcomes. Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents known  as renin inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to discuss the  clinical pharmacology of aliskiren and its use in the management of hypertension,  as well as potential uses in other cardiovascular disorders. METHODS:  Peer-reviewed articles and abstracts were identified from the MEDLINE and Current  Contents databases (both 1966-October 1, 2007) using the search terms aliskiren,  drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. Citations from available  articles were reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at recent  professional meetings were also examined. RESULTS: Nine published clinical  studies have evaluated the effect of aliskiren in lowering blood pressure in  hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive  agents. This review summarizes those studies. Patients treated with aliskiren had  significantly lower blood pressure compared with patients with mild to moderate  hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140-180 mm Hg and diastolic blood  pressure [DBP] 95-110 mm Hg) who received placebo. Aliskiren in doses of 75 to  300 mg daily produced reductions of SBP (-5.3 to -15.8 mm Hg) and DBP (-5.8 to  -12.3 mm Hg); placebo produced reductions of SBP that ranged from -2.85 to -10.0  mm Hg and DBP reductions from -3.26 to -8.6 mm Hg (P < 0.05 in all studies  between aliskiren and placebo). Aliskiren's blood pressure-lowering effect at  doses of 75 to 300 mg daily was comparable to irbesartan 150 mg daily and  valsartan 80 to 360 mg daily alone. When aliskiren was added to ramipril,  hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan, or valsartan, significant additive  blood pressure-lowering effects were reported (P < 0.05 in all clinical trials).  The total incidence of adverse events was similar to placebo and other  comparative agents, including irbesartan, valsartan, losartan, ramipril, and  hydrochlorothiazide. The overall adverse-event rates were 22%, 35% to 52%, 25% to  52%, 34% to 55%, and 33% to 52% for aliskiren 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg,  respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events included headache,  dizziness, and fatigue. Studies with cardiovascular outcomes as end points have  not been performed with aliskiren.

In patients with hypertension,  aliskiren can be used either as monotherapy or in combination with other  antihypertensive agents. By inhibiting renin, aliskiren blocks the conversion of  angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which subsequently results in a reduction in  angiotensin II concentrations. Unlike the angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which reactively  stimulate an increase in plasma renin activity, aliskiren suppresses the effects  of renin and leads to a reduction in plasma renin activity. In clinical trials  involving patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, aliskiren provided  antihypertensive efficacy that was comparable to that of an ARB. Combination  therapy with aliskiren and an ARB may provide additional blood pressure-lowering  effects compared with the respective monotherapies with each of the agents. The  results from surrogate outcome studies have also alluded to the potential for  aliskiren to prevent target organ damage. Because aliskiren does not  significantly affect the cytochrome P450 system, it has been associated with few  drug interactions. In clinical studies, aliskiren was well tolerated, and its  adverse-effect profile was similar to that of placebo. Fatigue, headache,  dizziness, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and back pain were the most commonly  reported adverse events. Overall, aliskiren appears to be a reasonable treatment  option for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension who are intolerant of  first-line antihypertensive therapies. Aliskiren may also be a promising  renoprotective strategy in patients with concomitant hypertension and diabetes  mellitus. Its potential as a first-line antihypertensive agent will have to be  further examined once studies evaluating its effects on long-term clinical  outcomes are completed.","2009-02","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","193-212","","2","29","","Pharmacotherapy","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19170589","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Administration, Oral; Drug Interactions; United States; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug Approval; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Renin/antagonists & inhibitors; Antihypertensive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Amides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Diabetes Complications/drug therapy; Fumarates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE  (1966-January 2007), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-January 2007),  and Cochrane database (2006) for the key words aliskiren or SPP100. References of  selected articles were also reviewed. Abstract data were included only in the  absence of significant published data. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION:  Available English-language data from reviews, abstracts, and clinical trials were  selected. For review of efficacy, randomized controlled trials were preferred.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor, the first in a new class of  antihypertensives. As renin catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the  renin-angiotensin system (RAS), renin inhibition may offer a theoretical  advantage over other RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). In short-term clinical  trials (< or =8 wk) of subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension, single daily  doses of aliskiren 150-300 mg produced significant systolic and diastolic blood  pressure reduction similar to that achieved with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, with  placebo-like tolerability, without an elevation in heart rate or evidence of  tolerance.

To investigate whether aliskiren  accumulation in secretory granules contributes to these phenomena,  renin-synthesizing mast cells were incubated with aliskiren, washed, and exposed  to forskolin in medium without aliskiren (0.1 to 1000 nmol/L). (Pro)renin  concentrations were measured by renin- and prorenin-specific immunoradiometric  assays, and renin activity was measured by enzyme-kinetic assay. Without  aliskiren, the culture medium predominantly contained prorenin, the cells  exclusively stored renin, and forskolin doubled renin release. Aliskiren  dose-dependently bound to (pro)renin in the medium and cell lysates and did not  alter the effect of forskolin. The aliskiren concentrations required to bind  prorenin were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those needed to bind renin.  Blockade of cell lysate renin activity ranged from 27+/-15% to 79+/-5%, and these  percentages were identical for the renin that was released by forskolin,  indicating that they represented the same renin pool, ie, the renin storage  granules. Comparison of renin and prorenin measurements in blood samples obtained  from human volunteers treated with aliskiren, both before and after prorenin  activation, revealed that <or=30% of prorenin was detected in renin-specific  assays. In conclusion, aliskiren accumulates in renin granules, thus allowing  long-lasting renin-angiotensin system blockade beyond the half-life of this drug.  Aliskiren also binds to prorenin. This allows its detection as renin, and might  explain, in part, the renin rise during renin inhibition.","2008-12","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","1076-1083","","6","52","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18981317","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Cell Line, Tumor; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin I/metabolism; Culture Media/metabolism; Colforsin/pharmacology; Amides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Fumarates/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Leukemia, Mast-Cell; Mast Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism; Renin/*blood/metabolism; Secretory Vesicles/drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At  variance with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aliskiren  eliminates the main substrate for the 'escape' phenomenon (synthesis of  angiotensin II from angiotensin I through alternative enzymatic pathways). The  possibility that the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren differs from that of  ACE inhibitors needs to be proved in specifically designed clinical trials. Over  the past 2 years, three studies have been published which directly compared  aliskiren with ramipril, in patients with hypertension. We made a pooled analysis  of these studies. In order to avoid interference with additional drugs, analysis  was restricted to trial periods when the two drugs were given as monotherapy. In  each individual study, systolic blood pressure (BP) was slightly lower with  aliskiren. Overall, systolic BP was lower with aliskiren than with ramipril  (weighted mean difference between the treatments 1.84 mmHg; fixed effect model; p  < 0.0001; and 1.87 mmHg; random effect model; p = 0.0055). The standardized mean  difference between the treatments was 2.58 (fixed effect model; p < 0.0001) and  2.92 (random effect model; p = 0.0017) in favor of aliskiren. Compared with  ramipril, aliskiren may have induced a more complete 'upstream' inhibition of the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with consequent greater suppression of  angiotensin II. Another potential explanation may be the longer terminal  elimination halflife of aliskiren (about 40 hours) compared with ramiprilat  (13-17 hours). These data provide further evidence that aliskiren monotherapy  provides a sustained BP reduction over the 24 hours.","2010-06","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","193-200","","3","4","","Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20418269","","","","Humans; Half-Life; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Aging; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Amides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Angiotensin II/antagonists & inhibitors; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Diabetic Angiopathies/drug therapy; Fumarates/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Ramipril/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aliskiren distributed  extensively to the kidneys of normotensive (non)diabetic rats, localizing in the  glomeruli and vessel walls after 2 hours exposure. In diabetic TG(mRen-2)27 rats,  aliskiren (10 or 30 mg/kg per day, 10 weeks) lowered blood pressure, prevented  albuminuria, and suppressed renal transforming growth factor-beta and collagen I  expression versus vehicle. Aliskiren reduced (pro)renin receptor expression in  glomeruli, tubules, and cortical vessels compared to vehicle (in situ  hybridization). In human mesangial cells, aliskiren (0.1 micromol/L to 10  micromol/L) did not inhibit binding of (125)I-renin to the (pro)renin receptor,  nor did it alter the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 by  renin (20 nmol/L) preincubated with aliskiren (100 nmol/L) or affect gene  expression of the (pro)renin receptor.

We report the results of animal experiments performed in  marmosets and rats in order to characterize aliskiren before its recent  investigation in humans. METHODS: The effects of aliskiren were investigated in  sodium-depleted marmosets (oral dosing) and in spontaneously hypertensive rats  (dosing via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps). Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate  were measured by radiotelemetry. RESULTS: In sodium-depleted marmosets, single  oral doses of aliskiren (1-30 mg/kg) dose-dependently lowered BP. At a dose of 3  mg/kg, peak effects were observed 1 h after dosing (-30 +/- 4 mmHg, n = 6) and  the response persisted for more than 12 h. A single oral dose of 3 mg/kg  aliskiren was more effective than the same dose of either remikiren or zankiren,  two orally active renin inhibitors previously tested in humans. Aliskiren (10  mg/kg) was at least as effective as equal doses of the AT1-receptor blocker  valsartan or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril. In  spontaneously hypertensive rats, aliskiren dose-dependently (10-100 mg/kg per  day) decreased BP. Aliskiren also potentiated the antihypertensive effects of low  doses of valsartan or benazeprilat (1 or 3 mg/kg per day). CONCLUSIONS: Aliskiren  is an orally effective, long-lasting renin inhibitor that shows antihypertensive  efficacy in animals superior to previous renin inhibitors and at least equivalent  to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1-receptor blockers.

Additionally, some of these blockers of the renin-angiotensin system  have been documented to enhance the anticonvulsant activity of antiepileptic  drugs against maximal electroshock-induced seizures. The aim of the current study  was to investigate the effect of aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor and a novel  antihypertensive drug, on the protective action of numerous antiepileptic drugs  (carbamazepine, valproate, clonazepam, phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine,  topiramate and pregabalin) in the test of maximal electroshock in mice. The  examined drugs were administered intraperitoneally. Aliskiren up to a dose of  75mg/kg did not affect the threshold for electroconvulsions, however, aliskiren  (75mg/kg) enhanced the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam and valproate.  Following aliskiren treatment, a higher brain concentration of valproate was  noted, suggesting a pharmacokinetic interaction. In the rota-rod test, the  concomitant treatment with aliskiren (50 or 75mg/kg) and clonazepam (22.6mg/kg)  impaired motor coordination while clonazepam (22.6mg/kg) alone showed strong  tendency towards this impairment. The combination of aliskiren (75mg/kg) with  phenobarbital (25.5mg/kg) caused long-term memory deficits in the passive  avoidance task. This study shows that there are no negative interactions between  aliskiren and the examined antiepileptic drugs as concerns their anticonvulsant  activity. Aliskiren even potentiated the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam and  valproate against maximal electroshock.

The theoretical therapeutic  advantages for inhibiting the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin system  at its most upstream point have served as the impetus for the development of  renin inhibitors. The advent of aliskiren, the first in a novel class of orally  active, nonpeptide, highly specific, human renin inhibitors, provides a new  modality in the armamentarium of renin-angiotensin system antagonists. Studies in  marmosets and rats demonstrated that aliskiren reduced blood pressure in a  dose-dependent manner and is highly efficacious in blocking plasma renin activity  with parallel reductions in the levels of the other downstream constituents of  the renin-angiotensin system. Clinical trials in hypertensive patients have  confirmed these benefits with aliskiren whose blood pressure-lowering efficacy is  similar to or better than those of standard therapeutic doses of enalapril,  losartan, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is well tolerated, with  few reported adverse effects even at the highest doses tested. Given the  established beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and  angiotensin receptor blockers in the treatment of cardiovascular and renovascular  diseases, future studies may further elucidate a similar protective role for  aliskiren both as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy.","2007-10","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","242-256","","5","15","","Cardiol Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17700383","","","","Humans; Animals; Structure-Activity Relationship; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Regional Blood Flow; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Kidney/blood supply; Aldosterone/blood; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects/physiology; Irbesartan; Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Amides/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Angiotensin II/blood/physiology; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Fumarates/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Receptors, Angiotensin/drug effects/physiology; Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology; Tetrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hormonal and BP effects were compared for 48 h after  administration of single oral doses of 300 mg (high dose) of the renin inhibitor  aliskiren (A300) and 160 mg (standard antihypertensive dose) of the AT1 receptor  antagonist valsartan (V160) and their combination each at half dose (A150+V80) in  12 mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals. In this double-blind,  placebo-controlled, randomized, four-period crossover study, A300 decreased  plasma renin activity and angiotensin I and II levels for 48 h, stimulated  immunoreactive active renin release more strongly than V160, and decreased  urinary aldosterone excretion for a longer duration than V160. In contrast to  V160, the A150+V80 combination did not increase plasma angiotensins. The renin  and aldosterone effects of the A150+V80 combination were similar to those of A300  and greater than those of V160. When plasma drug concentrations were taken into  account, the A150 +V80 combination had a synergistic effect on renin release. The  A150+V80 combination lowered BP at least as effectively as either higher dose  monotherapy. In conclusion, in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals,  the long-lasting effects of aliskiren alone or in combination with valsartan on  plasma immunoreactive active renin and urinary aldosterone effects demonstrate  strong and prolonged blockade of angiotensin II at the kidney and the adrenal  level. Moreover, a renin inhibitor and AT1R antagonist combination may provide  synergistic effects on RAS hormone levels.","2004-12","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","3126-3133","","12","15","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15579516","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Drug Synergism; Administration, Oral; Cross-Over Studies; Valsartan; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Angiotensin II/*blood; Amides; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects; Angiotensin I/blood; Tetrazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Fumarates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Aldosterone/blood/urine; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Feedback, Physiological/drug effects; Renin/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood; Valine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may be attributable to drug  accumulation in the kidney as recently shown in rats and mice. Since aliskiren  binds to renin we examined in the present study whether this accumulation depends  on the renin content of the kidney. METHODS: For this we measured the aliskiren  concentration in the kidney of wild-type as well as AT1a receptor(-/-) and  Ren1c(-/-) mice. AT1a receptor(-/-) mice overexpress renin due to the lack of  angiotensin II-mediated negative feedback, whereas Ren1c(-/-) mice lack renal  renin expression. RESULTS: Accumulation of aliskiren was found in the kidney of  wild-type mice. However, renal accumulation was neither influenced by the  overexpression nor by the absence of renin in the kidney. It was recently shown  that the effects of aliskiren can be blocked by a handle region peptide, which  inhibits the nonproteolytic activation of prorenin bound to the (pro)renin  receptor. To investigate whether this putative (pro)renin receptor blocker  influences renal aliskiren accumulation, we administered the blocker in addition  to aliskiren. No influence on renal aliskiren accumulation was observed.  CONCLUSION: These data confirm accumulation of aliskiren in the murine kidney and  demonstrate that neither renin nor (pro)renin receptor-bound prorenin are major  players in this process.","2013-04","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","713-719","","4","31","","J Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 23407438","","","","Humans; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Protein Binding; Immunohistochemistry; Kidney/*metabolism; Mice, Knockout; Renin/*metabolism; Amides/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Antihypertensive Agents/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Fumarates/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of these, only  36.8% have their blood pressure reduced to recommended levels of lower than  140/90 mmHg for uncomplicated hypertension, or less than 130/80 mmHg for patients  with diabetes mellitus or renal disease. Since monotherapy controls blood  pressure in less than 50% of treated hypertensive patients, combination therapy  is often required to bring blood pressure to the recommended levels of the 7th  Joint National Committee report. One of the most effective and widely used  combinations is the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or  angiotensin receptor blocker with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).

As renin specifically catalyses the  rate-limiting step of the RAS, it represents the optimal target for RAS  inhibition. Several peptide-like renin inhibitors have been synthesized  previously, but poor pharmacokinetic properties meant that these compounds were  not clinically useful. We employed a combination of molecular modelling and  crystallographic structure analysis to design renin inhibitors lacking the  extended peptide-like backbone of earlier inhibitors, for improved  pharmacokinetic properties.

First, a basic RAAS model was developed in which  equations for drug effects were included and missing parameters estimated. Next,  a physiology-based PK model for enalapril and enalaprilat was developed and  coupled to the RAAS model. Simulation of the effects of angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aliskiren administration on  angiotensins I and II did not reveal significant overestimation or  underestimation. For all drugs, the error numerics were acceptable. The model  also encompassed the PK of intravenous and oral enalapril and its conversion to  enalaprilat. In summary, we report a physiology-based model for the interaction  of the RAAS biomarkers angiotensin I and II with enalapril, benazepril,  aliskiren, and losartan that allows for an adequate description of the RAAS  response after single administration of the drugs. Such a comprehensive  description may lead to a better understanding of the effects of pharmacological  interventions in the RAAS.","2012-11","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","417-428","","5","60","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23143654","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Injections, Intravenous; Computer Simulation; Biomarkers/metabolism; *Models, Biological; Angiotensin II/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects/*physiology; Enalapril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin I/*metabolism; Enalaprilat/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We screened ∼0.69  billion novel compounds from the ZINC20 library and repurposed ∼1400 FDA drugs  using computational drug discovery methods against PfIspC. Following our  computational pipeline, we found five novel ZINC20 compounds (Z-2, Z-3, Z-10,  Z-13, and Z-14) and three FDA drugs (Aliskiren, Ceftolozane, and Ombitasvir) that  showed striking docking energy (ranging from -8.405 to -10.834 kcal/mol), and  strong interactions with key binding site residues (Ser269, Ser270, Ser306,  Asn311, Lys312, and Met360) of PfIspC. The novel anti-malarial compounds also  exhibited favorable pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties. Furthermore,  through molecular dynamics simulation, we observed the stable dynamics of  PfIspC-inhibitor complexes and the influence of inhibitor binding on the  protein's conformational arrangements. Notably, the binding free energy  estimation confirmed high binding affinity (varied from -11.68 to  -33.16 kcal/mol) of these compounds for PfIspC. Our findings could contribute to  the ongoing efforts in combating malaria and invite experimental-lab researchers  for validation.","2024-02","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","128672","","Pt 2","257","","Int J Biol Macromol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Cytochrome P450 plays a crucial role in drug metabolism and responsible for the  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug molecules. Here, we  report the deleterious point mutations in the genes associated with the altered  response of antihypertensive drug molecules and their metabolizers. Missense  variants were filtered as potential nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  among the available data for the target genes (REN, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). The key  objective of the work is to identify the deleterious single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for the drug response and metabolism for the  application of personalized medication. The molecular docking studies revealed  that Aliskiren and other clinically approved drug molecules have a high binding  affinity with both wild and mutant structures of renin, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4  proteins. The docking (Glide XP) score was observed to have in the range of  -8.896 to -11.693 kcal/mol. The molecular dynamics simulation studies were  employed to perceive the structural changes and conformational deviation through  various analyses. Each studied SNPs was observed to have disparate scoring in the  binding affinity to the specific drug molecules. As a prospective plan, we assume  this study might be applied to identify the risky SNPs associated with  hypertension from the patients to recommend the suitable drug for personalized  hypertensive treatment.

With the use of special fluorescent dyes, chemical/hormonal responses  may also be detected. The delivery and site-specific effects of drugs can be  monitored in real-time. The capacity to simultaneously visualize both proximal  and distal segments of the nephron permits observation of the dynamic processes  within the living kidney and a quantitative assessment of the various operations.  Consequently, a clinically valuable and pending application for multi-photon  microscopy will be to provide real-time, quantitative imaging of basic organ  functions and their responses to therapeutic intervention.

In the present work, a training set of 18 drug compounds was used to  describe the affiliations between in vitro sinusoidal uptake clearance and the  fractional contributions of hepatic (metabolic and biliary) or renal clearance to  overall in vivo elimination. By means of these quantitative relationships and  using a validation set of 10 diverse drug molecules covering different  (sub)classes of the Extended Clearance Concept Classification System (ECCCS), the  relative contributions of elimination pathways were calculated and demonstrated  to well correlate with human reference data. Likewise, ECM- and pathway-based  predictions of total clearances from both data sets demonstrated a strong  correlation with the observed clinical values with 26 out of 28 compounds within  a three-fold deviation.

Here, we characterise a variation  of this model in which animals present stable hypertension. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers on blood pressure was  determined with adult dTG rats treated with enalapril from 3 to 12 weeks of age.  Tissue expression levels of renin and angiotensinogen were determined in dTG rats  and rhesus monkeys by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Upon withdrawal from enalapril,  mean arterial pressure (MAP) rose to 160-180 mmHg, with 95% of the female dTG  rats surviving for 6 to 12 months, In Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and rhesus  monkeys, renin mRNA was absent or weakly expressed in most tissues, except for  the kidneys and adrenals. In dTG rats, human renin expression was high in many  additional tissues. The expression of human angiotensinogen in dTG rats followed  a similar tissue pattern to SD and rhesus monkey angiotensinogen. Oral dosing of  aliskiren, enalapril or losartan provided a similar maximal reduction in MAP and  duration of efficacy in telemetrised dTG rats. CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril-pretreated  dTG rats are suitable for long-term MAP monitoring and sequential evaluation of  human renin inhibitors.","2011-09","2024-04-17 08:32:24","2024-04-17 08:32:24","","133-145","","3","12","","J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21393355","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Disease Models, Animal; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism; Macaca mulatta; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; Rats, Transgenic; Tissue Distribution/drug effects; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Amides/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Angiotensinogen/genetics/metabolism; Enalapril/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Fumarates/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND: Low blood pressure (BP) control rates among patients with hypertension indicate a need for improved treatment options. This study investigates aliskiren, the first in a new antihypertensive class called renin inhibitors. METHODS: Patients with mean sitting diastolic BP 95 to 109 mm Hg were randomized to aliskiren 150, 300, or 600 mg or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Patients completing this treatment phase entered a 2-week treatment-free withdrawal period. Office BP was recorded at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 of treatment, and 4 days and 2 weeks after cessation of treatment. A subgroup of patients underwent ambulatory BP monitoring. RESULTS: In total, 672 patients were randomized to treatment. After 8 weeks, aliskiren 150, 300, and 600 mg significantly reduced mean sitting BP (systolic/diastolic) by 13.0/10.3, 14.7/11.1, and 15.8/12.5 mm Hg, respectively, versus 3.8/4.9 mm Hg with placebo (all p < 0.0001 for systolic and diastolic BP). The BP-lowering effect of aliskiren persisted for up to 2 weeks after treatment withdrawal. Aliskiren significantly reduced mean 24-h ambulatory BP (p < 0.0001 vs. placebo with all doses) exhibiting smooth, sustained effects and high trough-to-peak ratios. Aliskiren was well tolerated; overall adverse event rates were 40.1%, 46.7%, and 52.4% with aliskiren 150, 300, and 600 mg, respectively, and 43.0% with placebo. Few patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Aliskiren provides significant antihypertensive efficacy in patients with hypertension, with no rebound effects on blood pressure after treatment withdrawal.","2007-03-20","2024-04-17 09:05:28","2024-04-17 09:05:28","","1157-1163","","11","49","","J Am Coll Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17367658","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17367658","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Follow-Up Studies; Administration, Oral; Risk Assessment; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Cross-Over Studies; Treatment Outcome; Drug Administration Schedule; Multivariate Analysis; Probability; Severity of Illness Index; Hypertension; Blood Pressure Determination; Amides; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Renin; Fumarates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
