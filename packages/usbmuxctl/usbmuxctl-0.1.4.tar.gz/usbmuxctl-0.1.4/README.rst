Purpose
-------

This is the control software for the Linux Automation GmbH USB-Mux. This repository contains
a standalone command line application and a python module, both of which may be used to
control USB-Muxes on Linux.

USB-Muxes contain an USB Hub, high speed analog switches, power switches and a microcontroller
for control. USB-Muxes enable the automated testing of embedded USB devices by
allowing the connection of a USB device to a DUT (device under test) without requiring
physical access.

The USB-Mux hardware and software is usually used with `Labgrid <https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid>`_,
but can also be made to fit your workflow by using it standalone or in a custom application.

Functional overview
-------------------

``usbmuxctl`` provides the following sub-commands:

* ``usbmuxctl list`` - Get a list of available USB-Muxes
* ``usbmuxctl status`` - Get the current status of a particular USB-Mux
* ``usbmuxctl update`` - Perform firmware upgrades
* ``usbmuxctl disconnect`` - Tear down all USB connections to the DUT and Device ports
* ``usbmuxctl connect`` - Create a connection between USB ports. Possible connections are:

  * ``--dut-device`` - Connect the DUT (e.g. a single board computer) to the Device port (e.g. an USB flash drive)
  * ``--host-dut`` - Connect the Host (e.g. a PC running ``usbmuxctl``) to the DUT (acting as an USB device)
  * ``--host-device`` - Connect the Host to the Device port

* ``usbmuxctl id`` - Set the status of the DUT's ``id`` pin used for USB OTG negotiation

Possible example use cases are:

* Testing the hot-plug reliability by toggling between ``usbmuxctl disconnect``
  and ``usbmuxctl connect --dut-device``.
* Testing USB-based firmware upgrades by sharing a flash drive using ``usbmuxctl --host-device``
  and ``usbmuxctl --dut-device``.
* Testing USB OTG functionality using ``usbmuxctl --dut-device`` (DUT in the USB host role)
  and ``usbmuxctl --host-dut`` (DUT in the USB device role).

Further documentation is available in the `handbook <https://linux-automation.com/umx-M01>`_.

Quickstart
----------

You can install usbmuxctl either directly from git or from pypi.
If you just want to give the tool a spin you should use the `pypi`-method.

Install from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone this repository and create a virtualenv for usbmuxctl:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/linux-automation/usbmuxctl.git
   $ cd usbmuxctl
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate

Install usbmuxctl into the virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip3 install .

You can now continue to test your installation using the help command.

Install from pypi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create and activate a virtualenv for usbmuxctl:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate

Install usbmuxctl into the virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip3 install usbmuxctl

Test your installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now run ``usbmuxctl -h`` to get a list of available sub-commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ usbmuxctl -h
   usage: usbmuxctl [-h] [--serial SERIAL] [--path PATH] [--json | --raw] {list,status,update,
   disconnect,connect,id,dfu} ...

   USB-Mux control

   positional arguments:
     {list,status,update,disconnect,connect,id,dfu}
                           Supply one of the following commands to interact with the USB-Mux
       list                Lists all connected USB-Mux
       status              Get the status of a USB-Mux
       update              Update software on the USB-Mux
       disconnect          Clear all connections between the ports of the USB-Mux
       connect             Make connections between the ports of the USB-Mux
       id                  Set the state of the ID-Pin to the DUT
       dfu                 Send the USB-Mux into the USB-Bootloader mode.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --serial SERIAL       Serial number of the USB-Mux
     --path PATH           path to the USB-Mux
     --json                Format output as json. Useful for scripting.
     --raw                 Format output as raw info. Useful for command line scripting.

Using as root
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To communicate with the USB-Muxes ``usbmuxctl`` needs permissions to access the
USB-connected microcontroller. The section below describes the correct way to
grant these permissions to your user.

To rule out issues with the configuration of these permissions for the initial test
you can run ``usbmuxctl`` as root by using ``sudo`` and a path to the
``usbmuxctl`` file inside the previously set up virtualenv [1]_:

.. code-block:: text

   $ sudo venv/bin/usbmuxctl list
   Serial      | USB-Path           | Host-DUT Lock? | Connections
   ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- | -----------
   22          | 1-3.1              | unlocked       | None

   $ sudo venv/bin/usbmuxctl --serial 22 connect --host-device
                                        +-----------------------+
                                        | USB-Mux               |
                                     +--|                       |
                                     |  | SN:   22              |
                                     |  | Path: 1-3.1           |
                                     |  +-----------------------+
          VCC: 4.95V    +---------+  |
   Host |>--------------|       1 |--+         ID: High
                        |         |           VCC: 0.00V
                        |       2 |----x    ------------|> DUT
                        |         |
                        |       3 |---------------------|> Device
                        +---------+           VCC: 4.62V


.. [1] The ``sudo`` command discards most environment variables when executing commands,
       making it incompatible with the usual virtual env workflow.

Using as non-root user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use ``usbmuxctl`` as non-root user you should use an ``udev`` rule to grant access
to the USB-Mux device to your user.
An example rule for Debian and Debian based distributions (like Ubuntu or Mint) [2]_
is included in the ``contrib/udev`` folder of this repository.
The content of this rule file should be placed in a file in the
``/etc/udev/rules.d/`` directory. An example installation, including the reloading of
``udev`` rules is shown below:

.. code-block:: text

   $ echo 'ATTRS{idVendor}=="33f7", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", TAG+="uaccess", GROUP="plugdev"' \
    | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usbmux.rules
   $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

After reattaching the USB-Mux you should be able to able to use it without
requiring ``sudo`` permissions.

.. [2] The ``plugdev`` group may not be present in your Linux distribution of choice.
       Please adapt the rule according to the groups provided by your distribution.

Using on Windows
----------------

Most features of the ``usbmuxctl`` utility can also be used on Windows.

Limitations on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows the following limitations apply:

* Updating the firmware: this feature has not been tested successfully on Windows.
  (In theory it should be possible to install  ``dfu-util`` and the drivers needed - but it has not yet been
  documented.)
* Using the USB path to select an USB-Mux.
  (On Linux this feature can be used to select which USB-Mux to use by the physical path on the USB.
  On Windows the path is not exposed by ``libusb`` and thus this field is empty.)

Installation of dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install ``python3``.
Make sure to add the Python binaries to your path during installation.

Afterwards install the `Windows driver package <contrib/windows/libusb_USB-Mux_driver_installer.zip>`_:
Download and extract the archive. Then run ``InstallDriver.exe``.

Install from pypi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We suggest to use the PowerShell to use this tool.

Create and activate a virtualenv for usbmuxctl:

.. code-block:: raw

   PS > python -m venv venv
   PS >.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Install usbmuxctl into the virtualenv:

.. code-block:: raw

   (venv) PS > pip install usbmuxctl

You can now run ``usbmuxctl.exe -h`` to get a list of available sub-commands.
