# GROQ without API

This projects uses playwright to Access [GROQ]('www.groq.com') using python

## Inspiration(Story)
On a long summer evening of april 2023 I was sitting in front of cranky old fan working on my [News-app](https://www.github.com/tikendraw/news-app). I needed a llm api to summarize the news articles. As a poor man I do not have money to buy llm subscription, I chose to use [Gemini]('https://gemini.google.com) (limit 1 req/sec), it took avg 8-9 sec per request to process, felt dissapointed.

At this point I have heard about Groq and its new LPU hardware that outputs insanely fast. 
There wasn't any free api for poor people like me. So I decided to emulate the user using playwright and can query and get the llm response. Finally as the thousands of seconds passed I could manage to make it work. Now you can too. 

I did it for poor people. 



## Working

* It emulates user using playwright and queries the selected model and ouputs the response as a json object.
* It uses cookie to login.(For the first time you have to login in under 120 seconds(browser will be open for 2 minutes), your cookies will be saved and will be used again next time you query)
* This code doesn't share your cookie or any kind of data with anyone.

## Installation
```
pip install groq-on
```
make sure you have playwright installed, if not do this
```
pip install playwright

#install firefox
playwright install firefox
