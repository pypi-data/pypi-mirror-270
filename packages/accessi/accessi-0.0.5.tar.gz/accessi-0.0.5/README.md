# Siemens Access-i Interface library
Library for Siemens Access-i MR Scanner Interface to integrate and control the MR Scanner. Based on Version 1.1.2 for NX (Access-i Developer Guide)

## Install
```
pip install accessi
```

## Siemens Documentation
The library is based on this document:
[Access-i Dev Guide NX V1.1.2](https://github.com/martinreinok/accessi-library/blob/main/documentation/Access-i_Dev_Guide_NX_V1.1.2.pdf)

## Usage guide
A sample test suite (tests.py) has been created which demonstrates basic Access-i usage.  
The tests.py requires Access-i simulator to be running on the background, on the same local computer.  
The tests.py demonstrates most of the implemented methods, as well as receiving images over websocket.  

## Collaborating
The majority of Access-i functionality is not yet implemented here, if you need more functionality, any additions are accepted.
