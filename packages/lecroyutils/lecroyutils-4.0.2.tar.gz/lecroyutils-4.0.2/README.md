    * accessing statistics
    * downloading screenshots
    * view and donwload waveform data
* parse LeCroy .trc waveform data
    * support for sequence mode

```

## Usage

```python
from lecroyutils.data import LecroyScopeData

# Parse a local .trc file
data = LecroyScopeData.parse_file('C2_00000_Lecroy.trc')

from lecroyutils.control import LecroyScope, TriggerMode, TriggerType

# Connect to a scope over vxi11
scope = LecroyScope('127.0.0.1')
scope.trigger_type = TriggerType.edge
scope.trigger_source = 'C1'
scope.acquire(force=True)
data = scope.waveform('C1')

scope.save_waveform('C1', 'C1_00000_Lecroy.trc')
