    A basic class to create loadable and dumpable
    (non human-readable) object using pickle.

    The class as a dump (alias save) method so
    an instance can be save as simple as calling this method.
    There is also a static method to load an object from a file
    that return an instance of this object.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qosst_core.data import BaseQOSSTData

        class MyData(BaseQOSSTData):
            x: int

                self.x = x

        my_object = MyData(x=3)
        type(my_object) # MyData
        my_object.x # 3

        my_object.save("test")

        my_object2 = MyData.load("test")
        type(my_object2) # MyData
        my_object2.x # 3
