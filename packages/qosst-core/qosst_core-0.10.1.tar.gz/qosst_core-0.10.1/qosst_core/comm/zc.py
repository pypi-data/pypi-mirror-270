    It takes as input the parameters of the sequence and returns the sequence in a np array.

    Args:
        root (int): the root of the Zadoff-Chu sequence. Often named u.
        length (int): the length of the Zadoff-Chu sequence. Often named Nzc.
        cyclic_shift (int, optional): the cyclic shift of the Zadoff-Chu sequence. Often named q. Defaults to 0.

    Raises:
        ValueError: when the root is not strictly between 0 and length.
        ValueError: when the root and the length are not coprimes.

    Returns:
