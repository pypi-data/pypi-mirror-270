This module contains the necessary codes to modulate and demodulate
data for the different modulations used in CV-QKD.

Here are some examples of use

.. code-block:: python

    from qosst_core.modulation import GaussianModulation, PSKModulation, QAMModulation, PCSQAMModulation

    # Create a Gaussian modulation with unit variance and 100 points
    gm = GaussianModulation(variance=1)
    points = gm.modulate(size=100)

    # Create a 16-PSK and with variance 2 and 1000 points
    pm = PSKModulation(variance=2, modulation_size=16)
    points = pm.modulate(size=1000)

    # Create a 256-QAM with variance 0.5 and 10000 points
    qm = QAMModulation(variance=0.5, modulation_size=256)
    points = qm.modulate(size=10000)

    # Create a PCS-1024-QAM with variance 5 and 100000 points
    pqm = PCSQAMModulation(variance=5, modulation_size=1024, nu=0.5)
    points = PCSQAMModulation(size=100000)
