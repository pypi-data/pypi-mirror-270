idk how to use the restructedtext thingy so uhh
(almost) all commands in this library:

smthfile(fp, mode):
    does the same what codecs.open(fp, mode, encoding="utf-8") does
    also check openfile(fp) and editfile(fp)

get_folder_path(caller, *args, create_folders):
    constructs a folder path relative to the caller's directory, optionally creating missing folders
    fore xample 👾👾👾👾👾👾:
        print(temalib.get_folder_path(
            __file__, "i", "am", "going", "to", "invade", "denmark"
        ))
        # output: file's_subfolder/i/am/going/to/invade/denmark

get_file_path(caller, *args, create_folders, create_file):
    does same what get_folder_path but last arg is a file (also optionally created)

add_line(fp, line):
    formerly altteotf() (add line to the end of the file)
