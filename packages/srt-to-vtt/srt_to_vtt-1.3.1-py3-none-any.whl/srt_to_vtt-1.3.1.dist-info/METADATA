You can now make changes to the package source code found in `srt-to-vtt/srt_to_vtt/` and see them reflected immediately.

## Format, build, test and distribute

Before doing anything else, make sure to bump the version number under `[project]` in `pyproject.toml`. Please use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).



Then, install the build requirements with
```
pip install -r build_requirements.txt
```

### Format

This project adheres to the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) code style. You can automatically refomat your code to Black by executing the following in the root directory of this repo:
```
black .
```

### Build
Then, to build, run
```
python -m build
```

### Test

After building the package, install it with

```
pip install dist/srt_to_vtt-#.#.#-py3-none-any.whl
```

You may now run the tests by simply executing
```

```

### Distribute
