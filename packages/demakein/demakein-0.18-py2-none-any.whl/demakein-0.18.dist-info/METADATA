Demakein is a set of Python tools for designing and making woodwind 
instruments.

This generally consists of two stages:

- The "design" stage is a numerical optimization that chooses the bore shape and the finger hole placement, size, and depth necessary for the instrument to produce the correct notes for a given set of fingerings.

- The "make" stage takes a design and turns it into a 3D object, then then cuts the object into pieces that can be CNC-milled or 3D-printed.

Demakein can either be used via the command "demakein" or as a library in Python. Demakein has been designed to be extensible, and I hope you will find it relatively easy to write code to create your own novel instruments. You can either create subclasses of existing classes in order to tweak a few parameters, or create wholly new classes using existing examples as a template.
