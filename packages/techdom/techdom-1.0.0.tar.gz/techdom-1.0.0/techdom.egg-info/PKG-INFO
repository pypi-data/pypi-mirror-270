# Simple Techdom Library

## Description
This Python library is meant to be used as a convenient way to get started developing techdom programs. 

I made this library since I personally found it time-consuming to get started doing basic things related to techdom. Therefore I  have gathered a selection of functions that should be useful to have on top of an already existing idea. 

The aim is to allow techdoms to focus more on their core idea by providing an easy to use library that aids with visuals and other nice-to-haves that aren't directly related to their original idea.

## Features

* Display images at a random place on the monitor (just like edgeware)
* Disable the sub's mouse and keyboard
* Hide settings on the subs computer
* Hide files and folders

* And much more!

## How to install

This library is published on pip and can therefore be installed by typing `pip install techdom`

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/FranklyShovelTrap/TechdomLibrary/wiki)

## Credits

Some of the code has been taken from the Edgeware++ project which you can find here: https://github.com/TheoWinters/EdgewarePlusPlus
