## Step 2: Running Simulations

### Training Agent
This command starts training the agent within the simulated queueing environment. Results are saved in `/foundations/output_csv` and `/foundations/output_plots`.

```bash
python main.py --function train --config_file user_config/configuration.yml --param_file user_config/eval_hyperparams.yml --data_file output_csv --image_file output_plots --plot_curves True --save_file True
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Below provides users two types of tuning strategies that feature different functionalities.

#### **Wandb Tuning**

A machine learning development platform that allows users to track and visualize varou aspects of their model training process in real-time, including loss and accuracy charts, parameter distributions, gradient histograms and system metrics. To run wandb:

```bash
python main.py --function tune --config_file user_config/configuration.yml --param_file user_config/eval_hyperparams.yml --data_file output_csv --image_file output_plots --plot_curves True --save_file True --tuner wandb 
```

#### **Ray Tuning**

An industry standard tool for distributed hyperparameter tuning which integrates with TensorBoard and extensive analysis libraries. It also allows users to leverage cutting edge optimization algorithms at scale, including Bayesian Optimization, Population Based Training and HyperBand. To run ray tuning:

```bash
python main.py --function tune --config_file user_config/configuration.yml --param_file user_config/eval_hyperparams.yml --data_file output_csv --image_file output_plots --plot_curves True --save_file True --tuner ray_tune
```

## Step 3: Explore Features

### 1. **Explore Breakdown Scenarios**

This feature allows the user to train the agent based on customed exploration preferences between key states and peripheral states using weight parameter `w1_key` and `w2_peripheral`. The purpose of this feature is to enable the agent to not only generate high rewards for key states but also visit all breadown scenarios sufficiently enough. 

Set up the parameters in `user_config\features_params\bloackage_explore_params.yml`:

- `w1_key`: Weight parameter to control favor exploring key states.
- `w2_peripheral`: Weight parameter to control favor exploring peripheral states.
- `reset`: A bool value that controls whether to reset weight parameters during training.
- `reset_frequency`: A value that defines the number of episodes frequency to reset the weight parameters.
- `num_output`: A value that defines the number of top and least reward/visits states to plot in a histogram
- `output_json`: A bool value that determines whether to output the json file of key states and peripheral states
- `output_histogram`: A bool value that determines whether to output the histogram that shows the rewards and visits of the top and least states.
- `output_coverage_metric`: A bool value that determines whether to output the current coverage metric.

To run this feature, navigate to `/evaluation/breakdown_exploration` and run:
   ```bash
   python breakdown_exploration.py
   ```

### 2. **Blockage Demonstrations**

This feature allows the user to test a trained agent's performance on a simulated server blockage queueing environment by visualizing the changes in transition probabilities. The purpose of this feature is to show how effectice the tranied agent is acting on breakdown cases. 

Set up the parameters in `user_config\features_params\blockage_demonstration_params.yml`:

- `num_sim`: Defines the number of jobs to simulate for each time step during training.
- `time_steps`: Defines the number of time steps to perform for each episode.
- `queue_index`: Defines the queue index that record the metrics for.
- `metric`: Defines the metric to be reported for the selected queue.

To use this feature, navigate to `/evaluation/blockage_demonstration` and run:
   ```bash
   python demonstrations.py
   ```

### 3. **Startup Behavior Identification**

This feature allows the user to visualize when the burn-in periods end on the learning curve. 

Set up the parameters in the script:

- `window_size`: Specifies the number of data points used to compute the moving average of the rewards.
- `threshold`: Defines the maximum acceptable absolute value of the derivative of the smoothed rewards below which a reward is considered stable. 
- `consecutive_points`: The number of consecutive data points that must all be below the threshold for the rewards to be considered as having stabilized. 
- `episode`: Specify which episode's rewards to analyze from a dataset.

To perform the feature, navigate to `/evaluation/startup_behavior` and run:
   ```bash
   python startup.py
   ```

### 4. **Confidence Evaluation** (need clarification from Josh)

This feature allows the user train multiple versions of the agent for different numbers of training episodes and then evaluate the performance of each agent on the simulation environment.

Set up the parameters in the script:

- `num_episodes_list`: A list that contains different numbers of episodes to train the agents.
- `timesteps`: A value that defines the number of timesteps to train the agent during each episode.

To run this feature, navigate to `/evaluation/confidence_evaluation` and run:
   ```bash
   python confidence.py
   ```

### 5. **Robustness Evaluation** (need clarification from Fatima)

This feature allows the user to train multiple agents, analyze their behavior, and calculate statistical metrics based on their performance.

Set up the parameters in the script:

- `confidence_level`: The statistical confidence level for calculations.
- `desired_error`: The target error margin for estimating statistical requirements.
- `num_runs`: Number of times to train agents.
- `time_steps`: Number of time steps each agent runs in the simulation environment.
- `num_sim`: Number of simulations to run in the environment.

To run this feature, navigate to `/evaluation/robustness_evaluation` and run:
   ```bash
   python runs.py
   ```

### 6. **Noise Evaluation** (Need clarification from Jevon)

This feature allows the user to evaluate the effect of environmental noise on the performance of the agent. (how is env noise defined here?) 

Set up the parameters in the script:

- `frequency `: The likelihood or frequency at which noise is introduced to the system. It must be a value between 0 and 1. This parameter determines how often, proportionally, noise will be added during the simulation. 
- `mean`: The mean of the normal distribution from which the noise values are sampled. This represents the average value of the noise that will be introduced.
- `variance`: The variance of the normal distribution from which the noise values are sampled. This parameter indicates the spread or dispersion of the noise around the mean.

To run the feature, navigate to `/evaluation/noise_evaluation` and run:
   ```bash
   python noise_evaluation.py
   ```
