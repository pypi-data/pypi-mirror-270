{"task_name": "imdb", "research_problem": "Fill out train.py to (1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative, (2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to `submission.csv`, and (3) run your python script to save the `submission.csv` file. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving predictions to `submission.csv` in `train.py`. The training epochs should be within 5 to save time. You must run your training script and save the `submission.csv` file; failure to do so results in the lowest score possible: 0%.", "max_steps": 30, "max_time": 86400, "max_seconds_per_step": 1800}
