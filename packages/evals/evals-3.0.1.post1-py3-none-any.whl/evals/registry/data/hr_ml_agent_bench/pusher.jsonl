{"task_name": "pusher", "research_problem": "Given a script `train.py`, execute it to see the current average return. Understand `train.py` to find ways to increase the average return, then do your very best to solve the environment by achieving an average return of 0. Details about the environment can be found in `environment.txt`, which will likely be helpful while writing your solution. Store the average return over 100 consecutive episodes in a file called `submission.txt`, as shown in `train.py`. The file `submission.txt` should contain a single floating point number and nothing else. Note: only `submission.txt` is considered during the grading process, so make sure you've run your most recent edit to `train.py` to save the most recent `submission.txt`.", "max_steps": 30, "max_time": 2520, "max_seconds_per_step": 504}
