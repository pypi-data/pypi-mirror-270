The central issue to this case, in \nso far as it is related to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), is \nwhether the Organisation had made reasonable security arrangements to protect \nthe personal data of the students and students’ parents that it had in its \npossession and control at the material time. \nMaterial Facts \n2 \nOne of the many preschools under the Organisation’s management is the \nSparkletots @ Kampong Chai Chee centre (the “preschool”). In the course of \nthe year, the preschool would organise various school trips, sometimes with the \nparticipation of the parents. In preparation for these trips, the preschool would \ncollect the parents’ personal data (including NRIC numbers) to allow for \nverification of the parents’ identity on the day of the trip. \n3 \nThe present investigations arise from one such school trip. A few days \nbefore the trip was scheduled to take place, a teacher at the preschool sent a \nphotograph of a consolidated attendance list to a “WhatsApp” chat group, \nreminding parents of the upcoming school trip. The attendance list contained \npersonal data relating to the 15 students in that particular class and their parents, \nand included the contact numbers and NRIC numbers of five of the parents (the \n“Personal Data”). The “WhatsApp” chat group comprised of the parents of \nstudents from that class. \n4 \nThe teacher who sent the photograph of the attendance list quickly \ndeleted it after being alerted to the disclosure of personal data by one of the \nparents within the group chat. That same parent later lodged a complaint with \nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”). The PDPC thereafter \ncommenced investigations into the incident. \nConclusion  \n14 \nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the \nPDPA, I am empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation \nsuch directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. \n15 \nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on The \nOrganisation, I have taken into account the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) \nThe teacher in question acted swiftly in removing the Personal \nData from the “WhatsApp” group; and \n(b) \nThe number of individuals impacted by the disclosure (15 \nstudents and 30 parents) was relatively small and the disclosure was \nconstrained to the group of parents to whom the Personal Data pertained \nto. \n16 \nTo its credit, the Organisation also acted swiftly to address their \ninadequate policies – a response which, in my assessment, carries mitigating \nvalue. The following remedial actions taken by the Organisation have therefore \nbeen taken into account: \n(a) \nImmediate suspension of all “WhatsApp” chat groups following \nthe disclosure;  \n(b) \nExpedited the implementation of a set of “Social Media Policy \/ \nWhatsapp chat group rules” that was already under development when \nthe breach occurred; \n(c) \nRolled out a suite of other policies across the Organisation \nincluding a “Document Retention Policy” and an “Information Security \nPolicy”; and \n(d) \nUndertook the development of a practical employee handbook \nand conducted refresher training for its employees. \n17 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, I am of the view \nthat these remedial actions have sufficiently addressed the current gap in \npolicies and practices relating to the handling of personal data by the \nOrganisation’s employees. I have therefore decided to issue a warning to the \nOrganisation for breaching its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA, \nwithout further directions or imposing a financial penalty. \n     \nYEONG ZEE KIN \nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER \nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nQuery: What is the Commission’s approach to cases involving effects on children or minors?"}], "ideal":"10"}

The Complainant’s \nconcerns arose because he was able to view another individual’s personal data \nwhen he logged into his child’s supplementary account on the ActiveSG App \n(the “Incident”) \nFacts of the Case \n2 \nActiveSG is a national movement for sports coordinated by Sport \nSingapore, a statutory board of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. \nIapps Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) is a financial technology company \nspecialising in mobile application development and marketing. Sport Singapore \nengaged the Organisation to develop, deploy and operate the Super Sports Club \nMembership Management System (“SSCMMS”). The functions of SSCMMS \nincluded membership registration, and the ActiveSG App was a component of \nthe SSCMMS. Members of ActiveSG could use the ActiveSG App to book sport \nfacilities, register for fitness classes and purchase entry passes to ActiveSG \nsport centres. \n3 \nSport Singapore is the owner of the SSCMMS and ActiveSG App. \nPursuant to the written contract between the Organisation and Sport Singapore, \nthe Organisation’s scope of work included providing and operating the \nproduction server for the ActiveSG app. The Organisation also developed, \ndeployed and operated the SSCMMS (including the ActiveSG App).  \n4 \nOn 1 March 2019, the Organisation’s engineer developed a security code \nfix for the ActiveSG App. The security code fix was meant to be deployed into \nthe enterprise environment (which was a test environment) for further testing.  \nHowever, due to human error, the security code fix was deployed into the \nproduction environment, resulting in the Incident. \n5 \nAccording to the Organisation, the personal data of 153 individuals (the \n“At Risk Individuals”) had been at risk of unauthorised access by 84 \nindividuals during the Incident. Out of the At Risk Individuals, there was actual \nunauthorised access of 108 individuals’ (including 9 minors below the age of \n18) (the “Affected Individuals”) names and NRIC numbers (“Disclosed \nData”) by 84 individuals who were able to view this information when logging \ninto their own accounts on the ActiveSG App. For 6 of the Affected Individuals, \nin addition to the Disclosed Data, there was also actual unauthorised access of \nadditional personal data, including (collectively, the 'Additional Disclosed \nData'): \n(a) Email address; \n(b) Mobile telephone number; \n(c) Home telephone number; \n(d) Address; \n(e) Gender; \n(f) Date of birth; \n(g) Race;  \n(h) Employment status; and  \n(i) Sports Interests.  \n6 \nUpon being notified of the Incident on the same day, the Organisation \nimmediately took the following remedial actions:  \n(a) Rectified the issue within 2 hours of the Incident; \n(b) Reminded its staff to be careful and vigilant in the course of their \nwork; and \n(c) Together with Sport Singapore, implemented the following \nmeasures: \n(i) Separated the enterprise environment and production \nenvironment that were previously on the same server;  \n(ii) Put in place 2-factor authentication for the  Organisation’s engineers to access the production environment. \nThis means that the engineers are required to obtain the 2-factor \none-time password from Sport Singapore to access the production environment;  \n(iii) Monitoring of affected users for suspicious activities; and \n(iv) Implemented dynamic QR codes for member IDs.  \n7 \nSport Singapore also notified the Affected Individuals about the \nIncident.   \n\nFinancial Penalty \n20 \nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the \nOrganisation pursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of \nsuch financial penalty, the Commissioner took into account the factors listed at \nsection 48(6) of the PDPA, including that:  \n(a) that the Disclosed Data included the NRIC numbers of 9 minors;  \n(b) The Organisation cooperated with the Commission’s investigations; and \n(c) The Organisation implemented prompt remedial actions (i.e. the \nissue was fixed within 2 hours of the Incident). \n21 \nOn 23 July 2020, the Organisation was given notice of the \nCommission’s intention to impose a financial penalty of S$11,000 and was \ninvited to make representations.

Henry Park Primary School Parents’ Association (the “Organisation”) is a registered \nsociety whose membership comprised parent volunteers. To register as members of the \nOrganisation, individuals provided to the Organisation their names, contact numbers, name \nof child and the child’s class in Henry Park Primary School (the “Personal Data Set”). The \nOrganisation had a website at https:\/\/hppa.org.sg (the “Website”) where members could \nview their own account particulars upon logging in using their assigned user ID and \npassword. \n \n2. On 15 March 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”) \nreceived a complaint. The complainant informed that when she performed a Google search \nusing her name, she found a search result of a webpage of the Website which disclosed her \npersonal data (the “Incident”). \n\n3. The Personal Data Sets of registered members were never intended to be disclosed online. \nThe Website had been developed by a parent volunteer using the WordPress content \nmanagement system.  \n \n4. The Organisation had conducted tests to verify that members who logged in to the Website \ncould view their own account particulars. The Organisation also verified that account \nparticulars could not be viewed when accessing the Website as a public user. Nevertheless, \nthe Personal Data Set was crawled, indexed and searchable by Google. This points to a \nweakness in access control that had not been picked up by these rudimentary tests.  \n \n5. Security testing such as vulnerability scans would have identified the access control issue. \nThe Organisation failed to conduct adequate security testing  before launching the Website. \nOn the above facts, the Commission found that the Organisation did not put in place \nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data Sets. \n \n6. The Commission  also found that the Organisation had not appointed a person to be \nresponsible for ensuring its compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the \n“PDPA”). Further, the Organisation had not developed and implemented any policies and \npractices necessary for it to meet its obligations under the PDPA.  \n \n7.

Respondent \n \nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 16 \nGROUNDS OF DECISION \n23 September 2016 \nBACKGROUND \n \n1. \nOn 18 March 2014, the Complainant informed the Personal Data Protection \nCommission (the “Commission”) that by entering either, \n(a) a random 8-digit number as a simulated membership number; or \n(b) a simulated Unique Identification Number (UIN) number (e.g. NRIC or \nBirth Certificate number with a valid check digit), \non the Respondent’s Swensen’s Kids Club website, \nhttp:\/\/swensens.prism4u.com (the “Website”), one could access a Swensen’s \nKids Club member account associated with that membership or UIN number. \nOnce accessed, the member’s name and date of birth (“DOB”) would be shown. \n \n2. \nThe provisions in the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) relating \nto the protection of personal data were not in force at the time of the complaint. \nThe Commission wrote to the Respondent on 2 April 2014 to notify the \nRespondent of the complaint and that the provisions relating to protection of \npersonal data would come into force on 2 July 2014. \n \n3. \nOn 15 July 2014, the Complainant submitted a further complaint claiming that \non that date, the Respondent’s Website still allowed access to a member’s \nname and DOB by entering either a simulated membership number or valid UIN \nnumber.  \n \n4. \nOn account of the complaints made, the Commission commenced an \ninvestigation under Section 50 of the PDPA to ascertain whether the \nRespondent had breached its obligations under the PDPA. The material facts \nof the case are as follows. \n \nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS \n5. \nThe Respondent has been operating the Swensen’s chain of restaurants since \n1978. The Swensen’s Kids’ Club is a membership programme which the \nRespondent runs for children between 4 and 12 years of age. By accumulating \na certain number of electronic “stamps”, Swensen’s Kids’ Club members may \nbe eligible for various promotional offers from the Swensen’s chain of \nrestaurants (eg a free Kids’ Club Sundae every month with dine-in food order). \nEach member would be assigned an 8-digit membership number by the \nRespondent. Membership numbers run sequentially. \n \n6. \nThe Website supports the Swensen’s Kids’ Club membership programme and \nallows a member to access information relating to his membership account. \nThe Website has been in operation since 2013 and is maintained and operated \nby the Respondent’s vendor, Prism4u (Singapore). \n \n7. \nAs part of the investigation, the Commission verified that access can be \nobtained to a member account on the Website by (a) entering a random number \nsequence simulating a valid membership number; or (b) entering a valid UIN \nnumber in the form of a birth certificate number. The Website did not require \nany password to be entered nor authentication in any other form before granting \naccess.  \n \n8. \nThe following details about a member were made available through the \nWebsite: \n \n(a) Name; \n(b) DOB; \n(c) Redemption status of Kids’ Club Sundaes and “stamps”; \n(d) Number of “stamps” accumulated; and \n(e) Membership expiry date.  \n \n9. \nThe Respondent was notified of the further complaint by the Commission on 5 \nAugust 2014. \n \n10. \nOn the same day, the Respondent made changes to the Website to remove the \ndisplay of the member’s name and DOB. The effect of the changes was such \nthat when the account is accessed using either a valid membership number or \nvalid UIN number, the only details available would be information concerning \nredemption status, the number of “stamps” accumulated and the membership \nexpiry date.  \n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION \n19. \nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its \nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered \nunder section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Respondent such directions as it \ndeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.  This may include directing the \nRespondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 \nMillion. \n \n20. \nIn determining the direction, if any, to be made, the Commission considered the \nfollowing factors:  \n \n(a) the Respondent was first notified of the vulnerability on 2 April 2014, \nbefore the PDPA came into force, thereby giving it ample time to take \ncorrective measures; \n \n(b) this infraction took place during the first month that the PDPA took effect; \n \n(c) the personal data that was disclosed was largely limited to members’ \nnames and DOBs; and \n \n(d) the Respondent took prompt action to remedy the breach within the \nsame day when notified by the Commission a second time on 5 August. \n \n21. \nIn view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue \nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a financial \npenalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning to the Respondent for the \nbreach of its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n \n22. \nThe Commission takes a very serious view of any instance of non-compliance \nwith the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary action to \nensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The \nCommission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against \nthe organisation(s) accordingly.   \n\nQuery: What is the Commission’s approach to cases involving effects on children or minors?"}],"ideal":"5"}

The central issue to this case, in \nso far as it is related to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), is \nwhether the Organisation had made reasonable security arrangements to protect \nthe personal data of the students and students’ parents that it had in its \npossession and control at the material time. \n8 \nAfter a review of all the evidence obtained by PDPC during its \ninvestigation and for the reasons set out below, I am of the view that the \nOrganisation had failed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the \npersonal data in its possession and control, and has thereby breached the \nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. This breach is attributable \nprimarily to the Organisation’s lack of specific policies or procedures in place \nto guide its employees on the use, handling and disclosure of personal data, \nespecially in the context of communicating with parents. \n9 \nIt bears noting that “security arrangements”, as envisaged in section 24 \nof the PDPA, encompass physical, technical and administrative measures to \nprotect personal data. Such measures include data protection policies and \nprocedures that employees must comply with in the course of their work. \n“Reasonable” in section 24 implies that the security arrangements in place are \ncommensurate with the nature and volume of the personal data that the \norganisation possesses and\/or controls. \n10 \nIn this regard, the Organisation has about 360 Sparkletots Centres with \nabout 43,000 children enrolled. By the very nature of its kindergarten\/ preschool \nbusiness, the Organisation collects, possesses, and handles a significant amount \nof personal data of minors and parents alike. The everyday frequency of \ninteraction between its staff and the parents of the children under the \nOrganisation’s care indicates also that specific policies or training would \nreasonably be expected to be put in place in order to guide staff on the PDPA \nobligations that will undoubtedly be engaged during their day to day activities. \nIn the course of their work, the Organisation’s staff are more likely than not to \nbe placed in situations where the use and disclosure of personal data is crucial \nto the discharge of their duties, as it was with the case of obtaining consent for \nand organising the school trip in question. \n11 \nThe Organisation has admitted that it did not have such specific policies \nor procedures in place to guide its employees on the use and disclosure of \npersonal data in their communications with the parents of students enrolled at \nthe organisations preschools. While it had a Data Protection Notice, this was a \ndocument that was intended to provide general information about how the \nOrganisation handles personal data. It was meant for an external audience. It \nwas not intended to provide detailed guidance to its teaching and other staff on \nhow they should handle personal data in the course of their work. Since the \nOrganisation handles personal data of its students and their parents, the \nomission to provide detailed guidance to its teaching and other staff is an \nobvious gap in its security arrangements. To my mind, the Organisation needs \nto provide guidance to its employees in the area of communications and \ntransmission of documents containing personal data, such as via messaging \napplications. The absence of such policies and procedures meant that the \nOrganisation had little assurance that its employees were consistently \nperforming their duties in a PDPA-compliant manner. This falls short of the \nstandard of “reasonable security arrangements”. \n12 \nThat said, the Organisation had provided PDPA training to its employees \nat the preschool, including the teacher who had disclosed the attendance list. \nWhile PDPA training raises employees’ awareness of their obligations, this \nserves as a useful illustration that mere training alone cannot be a substitute for \ndata protection policies and procedures in specific areas. Reasonable assurance \nagainst such incidents requires instituting and enforcing proper policies and \nprocedures within an organisation, with training sessions acting as the medium \nto communicate such policies. \n13 \nBased on the foregoing, I find that the Organisation has breached the \nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. \nConclusion  \n14 \nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the \nPDPA, I am empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation \nsuch directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. \n15 \nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on The \nOrganisation, I have taken into account the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) The teacher in question acted swiftly in removing the Personal \nData from the “WhatsApp” group; and \n(b) The number of individuals impacted by the disclosure (15 \nstudents and 30 parents) was relatively small and the disclosure was \nconstrained to the group of parents to whom the Personal Data pertained \nto. \n16 \nTo its credit, the Organisation also acted swiftly to address their \ninadequate policies – a response which, in my assessment, carries mitigating \nvalue. The following remedial actions taken by the Organisation have therefore \nbeen taken into account: \n(a) Immediate suspension of all “WhatsApp” chat groups following \nthe disclosure;  \n(b) Expedited the implementation of a set of “Social Media Policy \/ \nWhatsapp chat group rules” that was already under development when \nthe breach occurred; \n(c) Rolled out a suite of other policies across the Organisation \nincluding a “Document Retention Policy” and an “Information Security \nPolicy”; and \n(d) Undertook the development of a practical employee handbook \nand conducted refresher training for its employees. \n17 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, I am of the view \nthat these remedial actions have sufficiently addressed the current gap in \npolicies and practices relating to the handling of personal data by the \nOrganisation’s employees. I have therefore decided to issue a warning to the \nOrganisation for breaching its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA, \nwithout further directions or imposing a financial penalty. \n\nQuery: What is the Commission’s approach to cases involving effects on children or minors?"}],"ideal":"10"}

Its membership programme, \nknown as “homeclub by COURTS” (“Homeclub”) gives its members \n(“Members”) exclusive access to, among other things, events and discounts. \nThe Organisation regularly sends eDMs to Members with links to specific \nproducts on the Organisation’s website (the “Website”).  \n3 \nThe Organisation used a platform called Salesforce to create and send \neDMs (the “Platform”) and the Website ran on the Magento system1 (the \n“System”), an e-commerce platform. The System generated a dynamic session \nidentifier (“SID”) for each login to Homeclub on the Website. This SID would \nbe used for all subsequent activities within the session.  \n4 \nOn 31 August 2019, the Organisation sent an eDM to 76,844 Members \n(the “Affected Members”). This eDM, included for the first time, the New \neDM Link, which was meant to direct Members to the Homeclub login page. \nThe purpose of the New eDM Link was for Members to log in to their respective \nHomeclub accounts to update their membership identifier – Members were \nrequired to provide their mobile numbers to replace NRIC numbers that were \npreviously used as the membership identifier.  \n5 \nThe New eDM Link did not operate as intended, resulting in the \nIncident. The Commission’s investigations revealed the following:  \n(a) \nNotwithstanding that the eDM sent on 31 August 2019 included \nfor the first time the New eDM Link, the Organisation continued to use \nthe System in its default setting. The default setting comprised (i) the \nSID embedded in the URL of the New eDM Link; and (ii) cookie \nsettings to be refreshed after 60 minutes.  \n(b) \nThe default setting had not caused any issues when it was used \nby the Organisation to send marketing eDMs with eDM links directing \nMembers to specific products on the Website. As Members were not  \nrequired to log in to their accounts in order to view the specific products, \nthe SID embedded in the URL and cookie settings did not affect the \nfunctioning of the Website.   \n(c) \nHowever, the default setting should not have been used for the \nNew eDM Link – it led to the System assuming that every use of the \nNew eDM Link within 60 minutes of a Member’s login was part of the \nsame session. This meant that:  \n(i) \nIf Member X clicks on the New eDM Link and logs into \nhis Homeclub account without logging out within 60 minutes, all \nother Members who subsequently clicked on the New eDM Link \nwithin 60 minutes of Member X’s login would automatically be \ndirected to Member X’s account, without having to authenticate \ntheir credentials; and  \n(ii) \nIf Member X logged out while other Members were still \nlogged into Member X’s account, the other Members would only \nbe logged out of Member X’s account if they refreshed a page or \nnavigated to other pages within Member X’s account. \n6 \nAccording to the Organisation, 128 of the Affected Members clicked on \nthe New eDM Link between approximately 8am on 31 August 2019 and \n12.25am on 1 September 2019. The Incident led to the risk of unauthorised \naccess and modification of personal data in the Affected Members’ respective \nHomeclub accounts. In this regard, each Member’s Homeclub account \ncomprised (i) account information; and (ii) address book, which collectively \ncontained the following data (“Personal Data Set”): \n(a) Name;  \n(b) Email address: \n(c) Mobile Number; \n(d) Date of Birth (“DOB”); \n(e) Address; \n(f) Password; and  \n(g) Transactional information i.e. products previously purchased by \na Member.  \n7 \nIn addition to unauthorised access, the following types of personal data \nin the Affected Members’ Personal Data Sets were at risk of unauthorised \nmodification as a result of the Incident:  \n(a) The Affected Member’s name, DOB, mobile number and \nresidential address from his\/her account information; and \n(b) The Affected Member’s name, mobile number and residential \naddress from his\/her address book.  \n8 \nThe risk of unauthorised modification in [7(a)] and [7(b)] was possible \nbecause password verification was not required to make these changes. \nConversely, an Affected Members’ username (which was his\/her email address) \nand password could not be modified without password verification. An Affected \nMember’s Personal Data Sets also could not be downloaded by another Member \nwho had accessed his\/her account because there was no download function on \nthe Website. \n9 \nThere was no risk of financial loss to Affected Members through the \nIncident. While it was possible for another Member (who was given access to \nMember X’s account) to make a purchase through Member X’s account, he\/she \nwould have to provide credit card details to complete the purchase. This was \nbecause financial information (i.e. credit card details) was not stored in the \nSystem, and there was no reward system in Homeclub for the redemption of \nproducts or benefits.  \n10 \nBased on the Organisation’s investigations into the Incident, there was \nno evidence of any unauthorised modification to the Affected Members’ \nPersonal Data Sets. Other than the Affected Member who had notified the \nOrganisation of the Incident, the Organisation did not receive any further \ncomplaints or feedback.  \n11 \nUpon being notified of the Incident on the same day, the Organisation \npromptly took the following remedial actions:  \n(a) Fixed the error that caused the Incident at approximately \n12:25am on 1 September 2019 by changing the setting for “Use SID on \nStorefront” to “No”; \n(b) Implemented password verification for any changes to \nMembers’ account information and address book;\n(c) Put in place a standard operating procedure (“SOP”) to ensure \ncorrect link insertion into eDMs to protect personal data. For eDM links \nthat are supposed to lead to a login page, checks will be conducted to \nensure that there will be multiple concurrent user testing; \n(d) Took steps to engage an external vendor to work on security \nmatters (including data protection security), and disseminate this \ninformation to its employees; and \n(e) Emailed the 128 Affected Members who had clicked on the New \neDM Link to inform them of the Incident.  \nThe Commissioner’s Directions \n18 \nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation \nunder Section 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account as an \naggravating factor that this is the second time the Organisation has been found \nin breach of the Protection Obligation. The Commissioner also took into \naccount the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) \nThe Organisation cooperated with the investigations and \nprovided prompt responses to the Commission’s requests for \ninformation; \n(b) \nThe Organisation implemented remedial actions swiftly to \naddress the Incident; and  \n(c) \nThe Members’ Personal Data Sets was exposed to the risk of \nunauthorised access and\/or modification for a limited period of less than \none day.  \n19 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner \nhereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$9,000 within 30 \ndays from the date of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified \nin the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable \non the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until it is paid in full.

The Grab App also \nprovides a carpooling option referred to as “GrabHitch”. GrabHitch matches a \npassenger with a driver willing to give a lift to the passenger (on the way to the \ndriver’s destination) in return for a fee. On 30 August 2019, the Organisation \nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that, for \na short period of time on the same day, profile data of 5,651 GrabHitch drivers \nwas exposed to the risk of unauthorised access by other GrabHitch drivers \nthrough the Grab App (the “Incident”).  \nFacts of the Case \n2 \nThe Organisation’s investigations traced the cause of the Incident to the \ndeployment of an update to the Grab App on 30 August 2019 (the “Update”). \nThe purpose of the Update was to address a potential vulnerability discovered \nwithin the Grab App, namely, the application programming interface (“API”) \nendpoint (\/users\/{userID}\/profile) (the “URL”) that had allowed GrabHitch  \ndrivers to access their data, contained a ‘userID’  that could potentially be \nmanipulated to allow access to other GrabHitch driver’s data.1  \n3 \nIn order to fix the vulnerability, the Update removed the variable \n‘userID’ from the URL which shortened it to a hard-coded ‘\/users\/profile’. \nHowever, the Update failed to take into account the URL-based caching \nmechanism in the Grab App. This caching mechanism (which was configured \nto refresh every 10 seconds) served cached content in response to data requests \nto reduce the load of direct access to the Organisation’s database.  \n4 \nWith the deployment of the Update, all URLs in the Grab App ended \nwith “\/users\/profile”. Without the variable ‘userID’ in the URL (which directed \ndata requests to the correct GrabHitch driver’s accounts), the caching \nmechanism could no longer differentiate between GrabHitch drivers. \nConsequentially, the caching mechanism provided the same data to all \nGrabHitch drivers for 10 seconds before new data was retrieved from the \nOrganisation’s database and cached for the next 10 seconds.  \n5 \nAs a result of the Incident, a total of 21,541 GrabHitch drivers’ and \npassengers  data was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access (collectively \n“Personal Data Sets”):  \n(a) Profile pictures; \n(b) Passenger names; \n(c) Vehicle plate number; and  \n(d) Wallet balance comprising journal history of ride payments. \n6 \nIn addition to the Personal Data Sets, other data that was exposed to the \nrisk of unauthorised access during the Incident included GrabHitch booking \ndetails such as addresses and pickup and drop-off times; and driver details such \nas total rides, vehicle model and make.  \n7 \nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following \nremedial actions: \n(a) Rolled back the Grab App to the version prior to the Update \nwithin approximately 40 minutes; \n(b) Notified 5,651 GrabHitch drivers of the Incident on the same \nday;  \n(c) Increased the minimum “cash out” amount for wallets in \nGrabHitch to S$200,000 to prevent unauthorised transfers;  \n(d) Deployed a new update for the Grab App on 10 September 2019; \n(e) Reviewed its testing procedures including implementing \nmandatory automated tests for all API endpoints dealing with personal \ndata; \n(f) Updated governance procedures concerning deployment and \nsecurity verification on changes to IT systems and applications; and  \n(g) Embarked on an architecture review of its legacy applications, \nand relevant codes which had not been reviewed for an extended period \nof time.  \nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination \nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA \n8 \nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) provides \nthat an organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its \ncontrol by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised \naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or similar risks. It is \nnot disputed that the Organisation had possession and control of the Personal \nData Sets at the material time.  \n9 \nIn the context of the present case, given that the Organisation made \nchanges to its IT system that processed the Personal Data Sets, it is obliged to \nput in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent any compromise to the \nPersonal Data Sets. The Organisation failed to do so for the reasons explained \nbelow.  \n10 \nFirst, the Organisation did not put in place sufficiently robust processes \nto manage changes to its IT system that may put the personal data it was \nprocessing at risk. This was a particularly grave error given that this is the \nsecond time the Organisation is making a similar mistake, albeit with respect to \na different system.\n(a) The Organisation introduced changes to the Grab App (through \nthe Update) without understanding how the changes would operate with \nexisting features of the Grab App and its broader IT system, including \nthe caching mechanism.  \n(b) In particular, the Update involved changes to the URL (i.e. \nremoving the variable ‘userID’). The variable ‘userID’ in the URL had \nthe function of ensuring that data requests (including the Personal Data \nSets) were directed to the correct GrabHitch drivers’ accounts. However, \nthe Organisation implemented the Update without making an \nassessment whether the Grab App would continue to direct data requests \nto the correct GrabHitch drivers’ accounts without the variable ‘userID’ \nin the URL.  \n11 \nSecond, the Organisation did not conduct properly scoped testing before \nthe Update to the Grab App was deployed.  \n(a) As found in the Commission’s previous decisions, organisations \nare obliged to conduct properly scoped testing before new IT features or \nchanges to IT systems are deployed.  These tests need to mimic real \nworld usage, including foreseeable scenarios in a normal operating \nenvironment when the changes are introduced. Such tests prior to \ndeployment are critical to enable organisations to detect and rectify \nerrors in the new IT features and\/or be alerted to any unintended effects \nfrom changes that may put personal data at risk. \n(b) In the present case, the Organisation admitted that it did not \nconduct tests to simulate multiple users accessing the Grab App, whether \nconcurrently or consecutively. The Organisation also admitted that it did \nnot conduct any specific test to verify how the caching mechanism \nwould work in tandem with the Update.  \n(c) In view of the large number of GrabHitch drivers, multiple users \nlogging in concurrently or consecutively are foreseeable scenarios that \nthe Organisation should have simulated during its testing of the Update \nprior to deployment. Properly scoped pre-launch tests would have \nincluded an assessment of how the caching mechanism may affect the \nintended operation of the Update because the caching mechanism can \naffect data requests returned to the GrabHitch drivers.  \n12 \nFor the reasons above, I find the Organisation in breach of section 24 of \nthe PDPA.   \nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions \n13 \nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation \nunder Section 29 of the PDPA, I took into account as a mitigating factor that the \nOrganisation cooperated with the investigation, and was prompt and \nforthcoming in its response to queries during the Commission’s investigations. \nI have also taken into consideration that this is the fourth time the Organisation \nhas been found in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA. Given that the \nOrganisation’s business involves processing large volumes of personal data on \na daily basis, this is a significant cause for concern.   \n14 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, I direct the \nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of S$10,000 within 30 days from the \ndate of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of \nCourt in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the \noutstanding amount of the financial penalty until it is paid in full. In order to \nreduce the risk of another data breach, I also direct the Organisation to put in \nplace a data protection by design policy for its mobile applications within 120 \ndays of the date of this direction.\n\nQuery: What is the commission’s approach to a repeated breach of the PDPA obligations?"}],"ideal":"10, 13"}

Organisations \n \nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 11 \nGROUNDS OF DECISION \n29 June 2017 \n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS \n \n10. The information that was contained in the logbook, namely, the NRIC number \nand the dates and times of the entry and departure from the Condominium, would \nconstitute “personal data” under Section 2 of the PDPA of the coaches who came \nto the Condominium. The information allows for the identification of the individual, \nand the date and timings in which the individual had entered and left the \npremises. In particular, the NRIC numbers of the coaches are generally \nconsidered to be of a sensitive nature, as it is widely used for business purposes \nand transactions with the government,1 and could be used to cause harm should \nsuch information fall into the wrong hands.  \n \n11. Accordingly, since the logbook contains personal data of the individual coaches, \nit must be protected under Section 24 of the PDPA.  \n \n12. The issues that arise from this case are as follow:   \ni. What was the relationship between MCST 3696 and Eagle, and what were \ntheir respective obligations under the PDPA;  \nii. Whether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye complied with their respective \nobligations under the PDPA.  \n \nRelationship between MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye and their respective obligations \n13. The MCST 3696 had engaged Eagle Eye to provide security guard services \npursuant to an agreement on 15 August 2016.  \n \n14. As part of the security services, Eagle Eye was to record the movement of \npersons entering or leaving the premises of the Condominium. This included the \nmaintaining a logbook of coaches who were entering or leaving the premises of \nthe Condominium.   \n \n15. The recording and safekeeping of the logbook were activities that fall under the \ndefinition of “processing” of personal data under Section 2(1) of the PDPA. Given \nthat MCST 3696 had engaged Eagle Eye to carry out such services (as part of \nthe overall security services), Eagle Eye was a data intermediary to MCST 3696 \n(the organisation) in relation to the handling and safekeeping of the logbook.  \n \n16. As an organisation, MCST 3696 has the primary role and duty to protect personal \ndata in its possession or control under Section 24 of the PDPA. The organisation \nheld the primary role and duty to protect personal data, even though it had \nengaged a data intermediary to protect the personal data as well. This principle \nhas been elucidated in the case of The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and Global Interactive \nWorks Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 22. As for Eagle Eye, although it has fewer \nobligations to meet under the PDPA (pursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA), it \nstill needs to protect personal data in its possession under Section 24 of the \nPDPA.  \n \n17. We now turn to examine whether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye have complied with \ntheir respective obligations to protect the logbook under Section 24 of the PDPA.  \n \nWhether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye have complied with their respective obligations \nto protect personal data under Section 24 of the PDPA \n18. In relation to Eagle Eye, the Commission has found Eagle Eye to be in breach of \nits obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA.  \n \n19. First, whilst Eagle Eye claims that it had informed the security guard to keep the \nlogbook closed when not in use and to keep the book in the guardhouse if no \nsecurity guard was stationed at the table, the instructions were clearly ineffective, \nas none of the security guards had carried out those instructions. As the \nComplainant had found on 16 October 2016, the logbook was left unattended \nand open on the table. Further, the instructions themselves were bare and \nincomplete, as they do not, for example, inform the security guards how to \norganise themselves to ensure that the logbook is closed at all times when not \nin use, or who was responsible to carry out the task. The failure by Eagle Eye to \nprovide proper instructions to its security guards was a dereliction of its duty to \nensure that there were reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal \ndata in the logbook.  \n \n20. Moreover, it was not enough for the organisation to simply provide instructions \nto the security guards to safekeep the logbook without doing more – ie putting in \nplace actual processes or practices to protect the logbook. Without having actual \nprocesses or practices in place to protect personal data, Eagle Eye’s instructions \nwere but empty instructions with little effect. This can be seen in the manner in \nwhich the security of the logbook appears to have been carried: on an ad-hoc \nbasis, where there is no coordinated and comprehensive effort to ensure that the \nlogbook was safeguard or safekept with the security guards at all times. And \nindeed, this has been laid bare by the Complainant being able to take \nphotographs of the logbook without the security guards noticing. \n\n21. Additionally, the alleged instructions were not documented. This makes it hard to \ndisseminate the message to all the security guards, especially to the new \nemployees joining the organisation. As discussed in in Furnituremart.sg [2017] \nSGPDPC 7, without having written policies or practices, it would be difficult to \npromulgate the policies or practices effectively to the employees and staff of the \norganisation.  \n \n22. Second, while Eagle Eye had a data protection policy in place, the policy was \nspartan in terms of the policies that govern the protection of the logbook. The \nonly reference to the protection of personal data was a line which mentioned:  \n \n“To ensure that personal rights to confidentiality are respected in compliance \nwith the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and no disclosure of personal data \nof resident, visitor, contractor, vendor, delivery and etc”.  \nThe policy does not elaborate further on how these may be translated into actual \npractices or processes to protect the logbook. As mentioned in Tiger Airways \nSingapore Pte Ltd, SATS Ltd and Asia-Pacific Star Limited [2017] SGPDPC 6, it \nis important for an organisation to ensure that its policies are contextualised to \nits operations, so that they are pertinent and relevant to the organisation’s work \nor operations on the ground, and meaningful and useful to employees in the \ncontext of their work or responsibilities A simple or bare statement in a policy \ntelling employees to comply with the PDPA (for example) would not actually \ninform them how to protect personal data in the context of what they are doing.  \n \n23. Third, Eagle Eye did not seem to have a contingency plan for the safekeeping of \nthe logbook when the security guard fell sick and had to be replaced by another \nsecurity guard. When the replacement guard came late, that had apparently led \nto the shortage of a security guard to be stationed at the table to look after the \nlogbook. Rather than returning the logbook to the guardhouse, the logbook was \nsimply left on the table unattended. In the Commission’s view, there ought to \nhave been some form of system or process to ensure that when the security \nguards are unavailable to be stationed at the table, the logbook would, by default, \nbe returned back to the guardhouse for safekeeping. Again, this accentuates the \npoint that there was no system in place to ensure the proper safekeeping of the \nlogbook.  \n \n24. Eagle Eye claimed that their security guards were in close proximity of the \nlogbook, since they were stationed at the guardhouse, and had kept an eye on \nthe logbook. However, this was not the same as safeguarding the logbook itself. \nThe fact the Complainant was easily  able to take photographs of the contents of \nthe logbook and the surroundings, without any of the security guards noticing, is \ntestament to the need for having close supervision of the logbook, which may  \nonly be achieved in this case by keeping the logbook with the security guards.  \nBy being stationed at the guardhouse, this made supervision and monitoring of \nthe logbook difficult, and increases the risk of the security guards being blind-\nsided to any unauthorised access of the logbook that was left at the table. The \ndifficulty of supervision and monitoring was exacerbated by the fact that the \nsecurity guards’ attention would have been diverted (at times) to the activities at \nthe guardhouse, and away from the logbook.   \n \n25. With regards to MCST 3696, it had the primary and shared responsibility with \nEagle Eye to protect personal data. \n  \n26. The need to meet this primary responsibility ought to have been drawn into sharp \nfocus for MCST 3696, as this was not the first time that the hired security guards \nof the Condominium had left the logbook unattended. As mentioned above, the \nCommission had found the previous security guard company to be in breach of \nPDPA for a similar incident, and had been issued a warning for it. Given that the \nprevious security company was issued such a warning, the MCST 3696 ought to \nhave exercised closer supervision over the implementation and adoption of the \npolicies and practices to protect the personal data collected by the Condominium. \nFor example, by engaging with Eagle Eye in the planning and development of  \npolicies and practices that would be appropriate in the Condominium’s setting to \nprotect personal data, or by having general oversight over the security of the \npersonal data. After all, having gone through the previous experience of the data \nbreach incident, there would have been lessons learnt and improvements to be \nmade, which the MCST 3696 can impart or share with the incoming security \nguard company, Eagle Eye, for developing its policies and practices to protect \npersonal data at the Condominium.  \n \n27. However, the MCST 3696 had failed to meet this primary responsibility to protect \npersonal data. As mentioned above, the Commission has found a lack of \nadequate policies and processes that were in place to protect personal data. This \nis evident, given there was only one line in Eagle Eye’s policy on personal data \nprotection.

Ltd. \n \n…Organisation(s) \n \nDECISION \fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd. \n[2019] SGPDPC [34] \n \nTan Kiat How, Commissioner – Case No DP-1704-B0699 \n \n30 August 2019  \n \n1. \nWith the increasing prevalence of ransomware attacks online, this case gives \noccasion to restate the importance of making adequate security arrangements to \nprotect personal data and to limit unnecessary exposure of an organisation’s \ncomputer systems to such potential threats on the internet. \n \nBackground \n \n2. \nMarshall Cavendish Education Pte Ltd (“MCE”) provided a learning \nmanagement system (“LMS”) at www.mconline.com.sg (“Website”) to the \nMinistry of Education (“MOE”) schools. This was pursuant to a contract between \nMCE and MOE.  \n \n3. \nOn 1 February 2017, ransomware affected a substantial portion of MCE’s \nnetwork (“Incident”). On 3 February 2017, MCE informed MOE of the Incident. \nThe relevant government agencies were notified of the Incident accordingly, \nincluding the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”). The ransomware \nhad encrypted the files found on MCE’s servers, including files containing personal \ndata of individuals stored in the LMS, and made them inaccessible until a payment \nwas paid to decrypt them.  \n \n4. \nInvestigations revealed that the ransomware was an executable file on 1 \nserver. However, it affected data on 11 servers and network storage devices in \nMCE’s network. These 11 affected servers and network storage devices mostly held \nteaching material. However, the server in question and a network storage device  \neach held copies of the database of 206,240 active and 44,688 inactive users. The \ndatabase held the following personal data of its users, which were mandatory fields \nthat every user who signed up for accounts on the Website had to provide: \n \na. Login ID comprising an individual’s full or partial birth certificate or \nNRIC no.; \nb. Name; \nc. School name; \nd. Schooling level; and  \ne. Class. \n \n5. \nUsers could also opt to supply additional personal data using optional fields. \nAccording to MCE, however, users rarely provided such additional information, \nwhich comprised: \n \na. Email address; \nb. Address; \nc. NRIC; \nd. Mobile Number; \ne. Father\/Mother\/Guardian’s Name; \nf. Father\/Mother\/Guardian’s NRIC\/Passport Number; \ng. Father\/Mother\/Guardian’s Occupation; \nh. Father\/Mother\/Guardian’s Mobile Number; \ni. Father\/Mother\/Guardian’s Residential Number; and \nj. Father\/Mother\/Guardian’s Office Number. \n \n6. \nMCE found no evidence that the personal data in its servers had been ex-\nfiltrated. MCE’s internet service provider’s network logs would have captured the \ndownloading of a database of that size. \n \n7. \nHowever, as access had been gained to MCE’s servers to upload and execute \nthe ransomware, it meant that the personal data in MCE’s servers were exposed to \nunauthorised access. Further, the encryption of the personal data by the ransomware \nwas an unauthorised modification of the personal data in MCE’s servers. \n \nDirections \n \n27. \nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the \nOrganisations such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Organisations’ \ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the organisations to pay a \nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the Commissioner \nthinks fit. \n \n28. \nPursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and the investigation and assessment \nof this matter having been completed, the Commissioner is satisfied that MCE did \nnot make reasonable security arrangements and is in breach of section 24 of the \nPDPA.  \n \n29. \nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the \nCommissioner hereby directs that MCE pays a financial penalty of S$40,000 within \n30 days from the date of the directions, failing which interest shall be payable on \nthe outstanding amount of such financial penalty. \n \n30. \nIn assessing the breach as determining the directions to be imposed on MCE \nin this case, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors: \n \na. MCE was cooperative in the investigations; \nb. There was no misuse of the affected personal data that was reported or \nindicated; and \nc. MCE had put in place several remedial measures as indicated at \nparagraph 13 above. \n\nHowever, the Commissioner had to balance these mitigating factors against the fact \nthat MCE’s failure to protect in this case led to loss of personal data in the \npossession of the organisation to the control of the ransomware attacker.  \n \n31. \nRepresentations were made by MCE after being informed of the proposed \ndecision in this case, submitting that they had complied with the Protection \nObligation under section 24 of the PDPA. In the alternative, MCE requested for a \nwarning in lieu of a financial penalty or to otherwise reduce the quantity of the \nfinancial penalty imposed.  \n \nCompliance with the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA  \n \n32. \nIn support of the assertion that MCE had complied with section 24 of the \nPDPA, MCE made the following representations:  \n \na. By installing remote access software on the backup server and \nchanging the firewall configuration without higher level approval \nfrom MCE’s IT manager, the SE wilfully disregarded MCE’s IT \nsecurity policy;  \n \nb. As acknowledged by the Commission at paragraph 23, no \npracticable steps can be taken to prevent a situation of wilful \ndisregard; and  \n \nc. MCE had adequate supervisory measures, as seen by the fact that \nthe Incident was discovered after MCE carried out its routine \nmonitoring of the system, and MCE subsequently took prompt \naction to investigate the Incident.   \n \n33. \nThe Commissioner has considered the representations and maintains his \nfinding that MCE is liable under section 24 of the PDPA for the actions of the SE.  \n \n34. \nAt the outset, it is crucial to note that the breach was not one-off, as the SE’s \ninstallation and usage of the unauthorised remote access software on the backup \nsever took place on more than one occasion, but went undetected. In fact, the SE \nhad fully configured the backup server to function as an RDP server, should the \nprimary server fail, without the knowledge of his supervisor. This shows the \ninadequacy of MCE’s supervisory mechanisms.  \n \n35. \nIt should be noted that the Organisation, through a written statement made \nby its GM of Prd. Devpt. on 2 June 2017, had admitted that: \n \na. “At the time of the incident, there were no measures in place to \nprevent system engineers to install unauthorised software, such as \nTeamviewer [a remote access software]”; and \n \nb. “They [the IT team] were not required to notify anyone else if \nchanges were made to the firewall configurations. There are no \nstandard operating procedures to document such changes.” The \nOrganisation also admitted that this was a lapse on their part and \nhave tightened their process following a security audit by their \nvendor.  \n \n36. \nThe Organisation in its representations has stated that it had a policy in place \nwhich required the SE to seek higher level approval from the IT Manager for the \ninstallation of remote access software and the Firewall Rule Change. Assuming that \nthe statement made by the GM of Prd. Devpt. on 2 June 2017 and the statements \nmade in the representations are true and are consistent with each other, the \nreasonable conclusion is that, while there was a policy requiring such higher level \napprovals, this policy was not adequately implemented and there was a lack of\nsupervision and monitoring over both the installation of remote access software and \nthe Firewall Rule Change. In practice, the SE was allowed to take whatever action \nhe deemed fit without any supervisory oversight from the IT Manager or any other \nsupervisor even if this resulted in compromising the Organisation’s IT security.  \n \n37. \nIn this regard, the fact that the SE was able to wilfully disregard MCE’s \nprocedures on more than one occasion over a period of time, without this activity \nbeing detected, highlighted MCE’s failure to translate the policy into a process \nwhich sufficiently complies with section 24 of the PDPA. Merely putting in place \npolicies is insufficient to fulfil MCE’s  obligation under section 24 of the PDPA – \nMCE must also have taken practicable steps to implement these policies, for \nexample, as set out above at paragraph 21 through adequate supervision and\/or \nmonitoring.   \n \nImposition of financial penalty  \n \n38. \nIn support of their request that the Commission should issue a warning \ninstead of a financial penalty or otherwise reduce the quantity of the financial \npenalty imposed, MCE made the following representations:  \n \na. The Commission failed to consider all relevant mitigating factors in \narriving at the preliminary decision;  \n \nb. The proposed financial penalty is manifestly excessive in light of \nprevious decisions issued by the Commission for similar or even \nmore serious breaches; and \n \nc. It would be extremely prejudicial for MCE if the Commission were \nto issue a decision and impose penalties on MCE almost two years \nafter the Incident, as the public may have the misconception that the \nIncident took place recently and MCE currently does not have \nreasonable security arrangements to protect personal data that is in \nits possession.  \n \n39. \nMCE raised the following mitigating factors in its representations:  \n \na. There was clearly no loss of personal data;  \nb. No personal data was accessed by the perpetrator or any third party \nand no individual can or will be affected by the Incident;  \nc. MCE took immediate steps to reduce the damage caused by the \nIncident;  \nd. There were no prior breaches of the PDPA on the part of MCE; and  \ne. MCE had not acted deliberately or wilfully.  \n \n40. \nAs the personal data had been rendered inaccessible by encryption, MCE \nhad in fact lost access and control of the personal data. Also, because of the \nunauthorised encryption of files containing the personal data, MCE was forced to \ndelete these encrypted files in accordance with its data protection policy. The main \ndatabase was modified because it was encrypted, and there would have been a loss \nof new incremental data created during the interval between the last backed up copy \nand ransomware attack. Furthermore, personal data was put at risk as the perpetrator \nof the ransomware attack could access the personal data if they chose to do so.  \n \n41. \nNevertheless, as noted at paragraph 30 above, the Commission took into \naccount the fact that there was no misuse of the affected personal data that was \nreported or indicated, and the fact that MCE had put in place remedial measures \nfollowing the Incident. The fact that there were no prior breaches of the PDPA is \nnot a mitigating factor in itself. On the contrary, if MCE had breached the PDPA \nrepeatedly, this would have been an aggravating factor, and it is trite that the \nabsence of an aggravating factor is not a mitigating factor.  In addition, the \ndeliberateness or wilfulness of MCE in breaching the PDPA is not a relevant \nconsideration in this case.  \n \n42. \nFurthermore, the three cases cited by MCE – Challenger Technologies Ltd \nand Xirlynx Innovations [2016] SGPDPC 6 (“Challenger”), Institute of Singapore \nChartered Accounts [2018] SGPDPC 28 (“ISCA”) and Bud Cosmetics [2019] \nSGPDPC 1 (“Bud Cosmetics”) are not analogous to the present facts.  \n \n43. \nFirstly, MCE submitted that only a warning was imposed in Challenger \nalthough the personal data of more than 165,000 individuals was compromised. \nHowever, the personal data leaked in Challenger was limited – it comprised only \nindividuals’ names, membership expiry dates and accumulated points. However, \nthe personal data in the present case includes personal data of minors and NRIC \nnumbers, and is thus of a more sensitive nature.  \n \n44. \nSecondly, MCE submitted that the personal data compromised in ISCA was \neven more sensitive as it included employment records and exam results, however \na financial penalty of only $6,000 was imposed. Employment and exam results are \nnot treated as sensitive data.  Furthermore, the number of affected individuals in \nISCA was substantially lesser – 1,906 individuals as opposed to more than 250,000 \nindividuals in the present case, and the unauthorised disclosure was limited to a \nsingle unintended recipient for a short period of 10 minutes. This consequentially \naffects the quantity of the financial penalty imposed.  \n \n45. \nThirdly, MCE submitted that in Bud Cosmetics, the Commission imposed a \nfinancial penalty of only $11,000 despite the fact that the Commission found \nbreaches under sections 12, 24 and 26 of the PDPA. As with Challenger, the \npersonal data compromised in Bud Cosmetics was not sensitive. Furthermore, the \nnumber of affected individuals in Bud Cosmetics was substantially lesser – 2,457 \nindividuals as opposed to more than 250,000 individuals in the present case.  \n \n46. \nLastly, the time taken to complete investigations into PDPA breaches and \nissue decisions may vary from case to case due to a myriad of factors. The present \ncase involved substantial technical complexities requiring a longer a period of time \nto complete investigations, consider representations and issue the decision. The \npresent Grounds of Decision clearly state the date of the Incident and the remedial \nmeasures taken by MCE. This would address MCE’s concerns that the public would \nbe of the view that the incident took place recently or that it has not remediated the \nbreach.  \n \n47. \nIn view of the remedial measures taken by MCE, no further directions are \nnecessary.  \n\nQuery: What is the commission’s approach to a repeated breach of the PDPA obligations?"}],"ideal":"41"}

API keys are in turn used to authenticate users seeking to access APIs. If an \norganisation fails to implement reasonable security measures to safeguard the security of their \nAPI keys, this may allow threat actors unauthorised access to large troves of data stored within \nmultiple interconnected environments.  \n2 \nOn 29 October 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”) \nwas notified that a database containing personal data of the customers of RedMart Limited (the \n“Organisation”) was being offered for sale on an online forum (the “Incident”). Subsequently, \nthe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether the circumstances relating to \nthe Incident disclosed any breaches by the Organisations of the Personal Data Protection Act \n2012 (“PDPA”). \nFacts of the Case \n3 \nThe Organisation operated an online platform selling groceries and fresh produce to \nconsumers. In 2016, the Organisation was acquired by Lazada Group (“Lazada”). Thereafter, \n the Organisation began to integrate its platform with Lazada’s online platform. The customer-\nfacing website and mobile application ceased operations on 15 March 2019. However, on the \nback end, the migration and integration of the Organisation’s system into Lazada’s system was \nnot completed by that time. It is worth setting out in some detail the Organisation’s information \ntechnology architecture to understand the backdrop against which the Incident occurred.  \n4 \nFrom March 2012 until its acquisition by Lazada, the Organisation’s business \napplications (including its customer facing website, mobile application, warehouse and \ndelivery back-end applications) were stored in RedMart’s Amazon Web Services Virtual \nPublic Cloud (the “AWS Environment”). The personal data of its customers and sellers were \nin turn, always stored in a MongoDB database within RedMart’s Alibaba Virtual Public Cloud. \nWhilst the MongoDB database is stored within cloud infrastructure that belongs to the Alibaba \nGroup, the Organisation remained responsible for managing its cloud environment (hereinafter, \nthe “RedMart Cloud”). The Organisation did not encrypt the MongoDB database, or \nimplement any password authentication requirement to access the MongoDB database.     \n5 \nAfter its acquisition, the Organisation’s intention was to re-design and migrate all the \nrelevant databases and applications from the AWS Environment into the RedMart Cloud to \nfacilitate its integration with Lazada’s systems and environment by March 2021. However, \ngiven the substantial time and resources required to complete the re-design and migration, the \nOrganisation opted to carry out the migration in stages. Following the acquisition and as a \nmatter of priority, the Organisation migrated its front end, customer-facing systems to the \nRedMart Cloud to enable a seamless integration into Lazada’s environment and platform for \nits customers. This was completed on 15 March 2019, after which the Organisation shut down \nits public-facing consumer application and website. Additionally, the MongoDB database \nresiding in the RedMart Cloud containing the affected customer and seller data was \ndisconnected from the application and website (the “Affected Database”), and thereafter \naccess by the Organisation’s customers was disabled.  \n6 \nIn contrast, the Organisation’s back-end business applications and systems (such as \norder fulfilment, inventory, transport and warehousing) and its seller portal continued to be \nhosted on the AWS Environment and linked to the Affected Database contained in the RedMart \nCloud.  \n7 \nConcomitantly, the Organisation’s back-end systems and IT infrastructure during the \ninterim period was structured in the following manner:  \n(a) The Organisation’s GitHub Enterprise repositories (the “GitHub Repositories”), were \naccessible by the Organisation’s employees possessing GitHub user and administrative \naccounts. The Organisation used the GitHub Repositories to store, amongst other \nthings, sensitive source codes including a Chef key that functioned as a high privilege \naccess key to the AWS Environment. The Organisation implemented the following \naccess control measures vis-à-vis the GitHub Repositories:  \ni. For GitHub user accounts, the Organisation followed GitHub’s password policy, \nwhich required the use of passwords which were either eight characters long if it \nincluded a number and a lowercase letter, or 16 characters long with any \ncombination of characters; and  \nii. For GitHub administrator accounts, two-factor authentication (“2FA”) was \nrequired on top of the password requirements above.  \n(b) The AWS Environment was accessible through the Chef key, and contained various \nprivate Simple Storage Service (“S3”) buckets, one of which contained another \nsensitive API key – the Hubot key.\n(c) Lastly, the AWS Environment was connected to the RedMart Cloud through an \nOpenVPN connection. The Affected Database was stored within the RedMart Cloud.  \n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision \n28 \nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation under \nsection 48I of the PDPA, and\/or whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial \npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were \nconsidered, with particular emphasis on the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) \nthe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations, \nresponding to the Commission’s queries in a prompt and forthcoming manner;  \n(b) \nthe Organisation had put in place some good data de-identification practices for \nthe credit card numbers in its possession by redacting part of the data and storing only \npartial credit card details. This reduced the sensitivity and harm that might be caused \nwhen personal data within its control are disclosed in a data breach; and  \n(c) \nthe Organisation swiftly implemented effective measures to mitigate the effects \nof the incident and prevent recurrences.   \n29 \nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the Commission’s \nletter dated 2 August 2022 and was invited to make representations.    \nRepresentations Made by the Organisation \n30 \nOn 23 August 2022, the Organisation made the following representations to the \nCommission seeking a reduction in the financial penalty: \n(a) \nThe Organisation had voluntarily notified the Commission and affected \nindividuals of the Incident even though it was not legally obliged to do so at the material \ntime, as the Data Breach Notification Obligation under Part 6A of the PDPA only came \ninto effect on 1 February 2022; \n(b) \nAs of the date of the representations, the Organisation was not aware of any \npersonal data of the affected individuals being misused as a consequence of the \nIncident. In support, the Organisation stated that the data in the Affected Database \nrelates to data used on its previous application and website which is no longer in use. \nMoreover, the data was more than 18 months out of date, and was not linked to any \ncurrent Lazada databases. Although the Organisation’s account passwords had been \nsecurely encrypted at the time of the Incident, it had conducted a forced logout and \n password reset on every affected current Lazada account upon discovery of the Incident \nto ensure that no third party could misuse the leaked passwords by logging into a current \nLazada account; and \n(c) \nThe Incident was the Organisation’s first breach of the PDPA. To the best of \nthe Organisation’s knowledge and belief, the Incident was its first experience of a data \nbreach.  \nVoluntary notification  \n31 \nThe Commission had already taken into account the Organisation’s voluntary \nnotification of the Incident into account in determining the quantum of the financial penalty in \nthe preliminary decision. Hence, this factor does not warrant a further reduction in the financial \npenalty imposed.    \nLack of misuse of the affected personal data \n32 \nThe fact that the Organisation was not aware of any misuse of the affected personal \ndata is neither here or there, and does not merit a further reduction in the financial penalty. \nWhilst evidence of exploitative use may be a relevant factor of harm that may be relevant for \nenhancing the financial penalty, the inverse is not necessarily true.   \n33 \nIn support of its representations, the Organisation cited the case of Learnaholic Pte Ltd \n[2019] SGPDPC 31 (“Learnaholic”), in which the Commissioner had taken into account the \nfact that “while there was actual exfiltration of the Personal Data…there was no evidence of \nfurther exploitation, use or disclosure of the Personal Data by the attacker”. It suffices to \nsay that the Commission has explained Learnaholic in Farrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd [2022] \nSGPDPC 6 at [35 to 36] as follows:  \n“35 \nIn the case of Learnaholic the main factors taken into account when deciding to \nreduce the preliminary financial penalty imposed were: \n(a) \nA reduction in the total number of affected individuals due to a recalculation of \nfigures; and \n(b) \nThe benefit of doubt given to Learnaholic as to the period of time the \nvulnerability in its system existed. \n36 \nThe lack of evidence of further exploitation, use or disclosure is not, ipso facto, \na factor meriting a reduction of the financial penalty. The Organisation’s \nrepresentations are not accepted as the lack of an aggravating factor (i.e. subsequent \nexploitation, use or disclosure of personal data) is not in itself a mitigating factor.” \n34 \nThe explanation in Farrer Park Hospital that is cited above is equally applicable in the \npresent case.  \nLack of antecedents  \n35 \nIn calibrating the financial penalty in the preliminary decision, the Commission had \nalready taken into account the fact that this was the Organisation’s first non-compliance with \nthe PDPA, and no further reduction is merited. In support of its representations, the \nOrganisation also cited Aviva Ltd and Toh-Shi Printing Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 15 \n(Aviva), where the Commission had taken into account the fact that the breach of the \nProtection Obligation by the organisation was its second breach in approximately one year, and \nboth data breach incidents involved similar fact patterns and causes. In Aviva, the \nCommission had considered the organisation’s previous non-compliance as a contributory  \nfactor that justifies an increase in the financial penalty meted as the organisation had failed to \nimprove its data protection practices. In contrast, the lack of antecedents in this instance means \nthat the Commission did not increase the financial penalty imposed on the Organisation. To be \nclear, the absence of an antecedent does not, ipso facto, merit a reduction in the financial \npenalty imposed.  \nAcceptance of the Commission’s findings \n36 \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Commission notes that the Organisation voluntarily \naccepted the Commission’s findings in the preliminary decision, that it had failed to comply \nwith the Protection Obligation and explicitly indicated that it would not seek to challenge these \nfindings. The Organisation’s voluntary acceptance of liability (even at this late stage) ought to \nbe reflected in the financial penalty. Had the Organisation accepted responsibility for the \nIncident at an earlier stage of the investigation, it could have significantly shortened the time \nfor investigations and resolution of this case through the expedited breach procedure and also \nbenefited from greater mitigatory considerations. Nonetheless, an organisation that voluntarily \naccepts responsibility for its non-compliance with the PDPA should be recognised as an \norganisation that demonstrates its commitment to the Accountability Obligation and shows that \nit can be responsible for the personal data in its possession or under its control. \n37 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commission hereby requires \nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $72,000 within 30 days from the date of the \ndirections, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of \njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty \nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full.  \n38 \nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no further \ndirections need be issued to the Organisation. \n\nQuery: What is the commission’s approach to a repeated breach of the PDPA obligations?"}],"ideal":"35"}

The Organisation raised the following \nfactors for consideration: \n(a) The Commission should not have placed such significant weight on the Personal \nData in the Reports that was exposed in the Incident. In this regard, the Personal Data \nin the Reports should not be accorded the status of sensitive personal data and treated \nas an aggravating factor because:  \n(i) The Reports did not contain the Affected Individual’s identification or NRIC number, health data or biometric data. The identifying \npersonal data was limited to the name of the Affected Individuals and the name \nof his or her employer; and \n(ii) The feedback data in the Reports would not fall within the realm of what \nwould typically be known as sensitive personal data as defined in Articles 9 and \n10 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”);  \n(b) Any aggravating weight to be given to the disclosure of the Reports must be \nreduced by the fact that evaluative purpose exception in the PDPA permits a prospective \nemployer to obtain such feedback or evaluative information without consent of the \nAffected Individuals. The Organisation posited that the evaluative purpose exception \ntempers the extent of breach or application of the Protection Obligation because \ndisclosure is permitted so long as the exception applies; \n(c) The possibility of a member of the public specifically carrying out keyword \nsearches of the names of Affected Individuals during the period when the specific URL \nlinks leading to the Reports had been exposed would not be high;  \n(d) The Reports were not more recent than the year 2010. As the Incident occurred \nin 2017, the accuracy of the contents of the Reports would have waned with the \neffluxion of time, and this could be a point taken into consideration by a prospective \nemployer; \n(e) In past decisions, the Commission has taken into consideration the financial \ncircumstances of an organisation in determining the financial penalty (if any) to be \nimposed. The financial penalty that the Commissioner intended to impose would have \na crushing burden on the Organisation, and cause undue hardship. Further, taking into \nconsideration the type of personal data and the potential harm to the Affected \nIndividuals, the proposed financial penalty would be disproportionately higher than \nwhat had been imposed on organisations in previous decisions; and      \n(f) The Incident was a one-off occurrence and there was no evidence that the \nWebsite was otherwise insecure. During the past 16 over years that the Organisation \nhas been in business, there were no other complaints in relation to unauthorised \ndisclosure of personal data.  \n24 \nWith respect to the Organisation’s representations on the nature of the Personal Data in \nthe Reports at [23(a)], Singapore’s legislative approach to determining the sensitivity \nof personal data is different from jurisdictions like the European Union. Unlike the \nGDPR, the PDPA does not have a definition of sensitive personal data. It is \ninappropriate to draw comparisons with the GDPR approach to defining sensitivity of \npersonal data as the jurisprudential basis of GDPR is markedly different from the PDPA. \nThe Commission’s approach in each case is to assess the nature of the personal data in \nquestion, taking into account specific circumstances such as the context in which the \ndata was collected and the potential risk of harm due to unauthorised access or \ndisclosure.   \n25 \nThe Organisation’s representations on the evaluative purpose exception at [23(b)] \ncannot be accepted. The fact that personal data that may be collected, used or disclosed \nunder an exception to consent cannot ipso facto be equated with an inference that the \nclass of personal data is less sensitive and need not be protected, or that there is less \nculpability for a failure to protect. It is necessary to examine the nature of the exception \nand the raison d’etre for its existence. The following analysis is confined to the \nevaluative purpose and is not intended to establish any special rule for personal data \ncovered by other exceptions. \n(a) The PDPA recognises that there is a class of personal data that exists for an \nevaluative purpose. A perusal of its definition discloses that the categories of activities \nare characterised by the need for full disclosure and frank discussions in order to arrive \nat a decision to, for example, employ, promote or dismiss a person, amongst a list of \nother circumstances that circumscribe this purpose. The recognition of the need for \nfull disclosure and frank discussions is carried through in a number of exceptions, \nwhich permit personal data to be collected, used and disclosed without consent.\nFurther, personal data in the nature of opinion data kept solely for an evaluative purpose \nis exempted from the access and correction requirements. The upshot of these \nexceptions is to recognise the necessity to preserve the space for full disclosure of \nrelevant personal data and frank exchanges of views between persons who are tasked \nto conduct an evaluation before making a decision or recommendations leading to a \ndecision. \n(b) Given the nature of the evaluative purpose exceptions and their raison d’etre, it \nis necessary to ensure that organisations accord personal data that is covered by the \nevaluative purpose exceptions with a higher degree of protection. The quid pro quo for \norganisations having the liberty to collect, use and disclose personal data without \nconsent for evaluative purposes, and to keep opinion data beyond the reach of data \nsubjects for access and correction, is that they are expected to put in place more robust \nmeasures to comply with the Protection Obligation. In other words, personal data that \nis kept for an evaluative purpose should be treated as sensitive data and be protected to \na greater degree.  \n(c) Further, the Incident in the present case involved the risk of unauthorised \ndisclosure to the world at large whereas the evaluative purpose exception is much \nnarrower in scope (i.e. it permits disclosure of personal data without consent to specific \nindividual(s) or organisation(s) only where it is necessary for evaluative purposes). The \nexpectations of persons who provided the 360-degree feedback would have been for \ntheir feedback to be accessed by persons with a role in evaluating the performance of \nthe employee under review. It would be difficult, by any stretch of imagination, for \nthem to accept that their feedback was accessible by the world at large. \n26 \nThe possibility of actual unauthorised disclosure raised by the Organisation at [23(c)] \nhad already been taken into consideration in determining the financial penalty that was \nto be imposed. While the risk of actual unauthorised disclosure may have not been high, \nthe fact that the Reports were exposed to the risk of unauthorised access and disclosure \nfor more than 7 years (between 2009 to 2017) is particularly glaring.    \n27 \nAs for the accuracy of the contents of the Reports at [23(d)], the passage of \napproximately 7 years is unlikely to make a significant difference to the potential harm \nsuffered by the Affected Individuals due to unauthorised access or disclosure of the \nReports, or dampen the expectations of the persons who provided feedback as discussed \nin [25(c)]. \n28 \nWith respect to the Organisation’s representations comparing the present case to earlier \ndecisions at [23(e)], it needs only be said that each decision is based on the unique facts \nof that case. The decision in each case takes into consideration the specific facts of the \ncase so as to ensure that the decision and direction(s) are fair and appropriate for that \nparticular organisation. \n29 \nThe fact that the Incident may have been the Organisation’s first data breach is not a \nmitigating factor. Conversely, if the Incident was a repeated contravention by the \nOrganisation of the Protection Obligation, this would likely weigh in favour of a higher \nfinancial penalty.   \n30 \nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has decided to \nreduce the financial penalty to the amount set out at [33(a)]. The quantum of financial \npenalty has been determined after due consideration of the appropriate weight to be \ngiven to the aggravating factors at [32], the Organisation’s financial circumstances and \nto avoid imposing a crushing burden on the Organisation. Although a lower financial \npenalty has been imposed in this case, this is exceptional and should not be taken as \nsetting any precedent for future cases. \n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions \n31 \nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the \nPDPA, the Commissioner took into account, as a mitigating factor, the fact that the \nOrganisation had promptly taken the remedial measures set out above (at [8]). \n32 \nThe Commissioner also took into account the following aggravating factors: \n(a) the Personal Data in the Reports were sensitive in nature as they included data \non the assessment of the Affected Individuals’ work performance and unauthorised \naccess of such data could potentially result in harm to the individuals concerned (for \nexample, the individuals’ future employment prospects may be affected);  \n(b) the Personal Data in the Reports was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access \nand disclosure for a period of more than 7 years; and \n(c) the Organisation showed a lack of awareness of its obligations under the PDPA \neven though it processes large volumes of sensitive personal data in the course of its \nbusiness. \n33 \nHaving carefully considered the facts and circumstances of this case and the above \nmitigating and aggravating, the Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation:  \n(a) To pay a financial penalty of $90,000 within 30 days of the date of this direction, \nfailing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment \ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty \nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full; \n(b) to appoint a DPO within 30 days from the date of this direction; and \n(c) to develop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the \nOrganisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA, and communicate them to its \nstaff, within 30 days of the date of this direction. \n\nQuery: What is the commission’s approach to a repeated breach of the PDPA obligations?"}],"ideal":"29"}

Ltd. \n… Organisation \n \nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION \n \n1. \nOn 13 February 2021, Sendtech Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) informed the Personal \nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data breach incident. There was \nan unauthorized access to the Organisation’s Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) account \nvia an access key (the “Incident”).  \n \n2. \nThe Organisation became aware of the Incident on 10 February 2021 when its AWS \naccount was shut down due to unusual account activity. The cause of Incident was a \ncompromised AWS access key. This access key was created in 2015 when the \nOrganisation was developing the backend of its server in its incipient stages. This AWS \naccess key had not been rotated or changed since 2015. The Organisation suspected that \nthe AWS could have been compromised through its former or current employees. First, \nall former developers had access to this key and some could still have the source code on \ntheir computers. Second, as most of the employees are working from home, it is possible \nthat the AWS access key was compromised if the employees had accessed internet \nthrough a public WiFi connection.  \n \n3. \nWith this compromised AWS access key, the attacker gained admin privileges, created \nanother admin account and queried the buckets storing personal data. As a result, the \npersonal data of 64,196 customers and 3,401 contractors and the contractors’ employees \nwere accessed. There was no evidence of data exfiltration. For the customers, the \npersonal data included the email address, contact number, home address and last four \ndigits of the debit or credit card. For the contractors and their employees, the personal \ndata included profile photo and copies of the NRIC or work permit (front and back). \n \n4. \nThe Organisation took the following remedial measures after the Incident:  \n \na. Rotated all access keys; \nb. Changed passwords for all servers;  \nc. Enhanced its audit trail on AWS buckets to log all read and write operation at the \nobject level; \nd. Checked and verified that its Github repositories was set to “Private”;  \ne. Engaged cybersecurity consultants to carry out assessment of its security setup and \nadvise on improvements to the security measures; and \nf. Developed new cybersecurity policies and processes which specifically include \nmeasures for credentials management. \n \n5. \nIn its representations to the Commission, the Organisation admitted to having breached \nthe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (the \n“PDPA”), and requested for the matter to be dealt with in accordance with the \nCommission’s Expedited Decision Procedure.  \n \n6. \nThe Organisation admitted it did not have specific AWS policies for the assignment of \nroles to rotate credentials. There was also a lack of detailed steps to manage credentials \naccess of outgoing staff. Hence, the credentials were not rotated or changed whenever \nthere are staff movement. \n \n7. \nIn the circumstances, the Organisation is found to have breached section 24 of the PDPA.  \n \n8. \nOn 23 June 2021, the Organisation was notified of the Commission’s intention to impose \na financial penalty of $10,000 based on the Commission’s consideration of the factors \nlisted under section 48J(6) of the PDPA, and the circumstances of this case, in particular \n(i) the Organisation’s upfront voluntary admission of liability which significantly \nreduced the time and resources required for investigations; and (ii) the prompt remedial \nactions undertaken by the Organisation. The Organisation was invited to make \nrepresentations. Having considered the Organisation’s representations dated 25 June \n2021 to reduce the financial penalty payable and to allow the Organisation to pay the \nfinancial penalty by way of an instalment plan the Deputy Commissioner hereby directs \nthe Organisation to: \n\na.

Ltd.  \n \nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION \n \n1. On 9 June 2021, Crawfort Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) notified the Personal \nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of the sale of the \nOrganisation’s customer data on the dark web (the “Incident”). \n \n2. The personal data of 5,421 customers were affected. The datasets affected \ncomprised NRIC images (front and back), PDF copies of loan contract \n(containing all the information in the NRIC, age, email address, contact number \nand loan amount) and PDF copies of income document (payslip, CPF \nstatements or IRAS Notice of Assessment).   \n \n3. The Organisation engaged external cyber security teams to investigate the \nIncident. The investigation identified an opened S3 server port in the \nOrganisation’s AWS environment as the cause of the Incident. \n \n4. The Organisation explained that it had opened the S3 server port for one week \nduring a data migration exercise sometime on or about 15 April 2020 for \nbusiness continuity purposes. On 3 April 2020, the Singapore government had \nannounced that the country will enter into a Circuit Breaker to contain the \nspread of COVID-19. All non-essential workplaces, including the Organisation, \nhad to be closed from 7 April 2020. In order to continue its business, the \nOrganisation had to pivot its operations so as to allow its staff to work from \nhome and its customers to make loan applications remotely. Within a very short \nperiod, the Organisation had to carry out the data migration exercise and as a \nresult, overlooked conducting a risk assessment prior to conducting the data \nmigration exercise. \n \n5. The opened S3 server port connected directly to the S3 server hosting the S3 \nbuckets, which contained the affected personal data. The open remote port \nenabled attempts to connect to the Organisation’s AWS environment from the \ninternet. Furthermore, the S3 bucket containing the affected personal data was \npublicly accessible due to a misconfiguration of the S3 bucket. As a result, the \nthreat actor was able to gain access to the publicly accessible S3 bucket during \nthe one-week period.  \n \n6. The Organisation the following remedial measures after the Incident: \na. Reset and reconfigured all whitelisted IPs to AWS server; \nb. Reset and reconfigured all VPNs; \nc. Limited the whitelisted IP addresses to its web portal; \nd. Conducted a penetration test; \ne. Monitored the dark web to ensure that data was not circulated; \nf. Engaged independent cyber security consultant to carry out investigation, \nstudy the IT infrastructure and propose improvements to their systems; and \ng. Notified affected individuals. \n \n7. The Commission accepted the Organisation’s request for this matter to be \nhandled under the Commission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This \nmeant that the Organisation had voluntarily provided and unequivocally \nadmitted to the facts set out in this decision. The Organisation also admitted \nthat it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (the \n“PDPA”). \n \n8. The Organisation admitted that it failed to conduct a reasonable risk \nassessment before carrying out the data migration exercise. There was no \naccess control to the S3 bucket containing the affected personal data during \nthe week-long migration exercise. This, coupled with the open port, allowed the \nthreat actor to gain access to the affected personal data.  \n\n9. In the circumstances, the Organisation is found to be in breach of section 24 of \nthe PDPA. \n \n10. Having considered the circumstances set out above and the factors listed in \nsection 48J(6) of the PDPA, including (i) the Organisation’s upfront voluntary \nadmission of liability which significantly reduced the time and resources \nrequired for investigations; and (ii) the prompt remedial actions undertaken by \nthe Organisation, the Commission considered that it would be most appropriate \nin lieu of imposing a financial penalty, to direct the Organisation to comply with \nthe following: \na. To engage qualified security service provider to conduct a thorough security \naudit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the security and \nmaintenance of its AWS S3 environment that contains personal data in the \nOrganisation’s possession or control;  \nb. Provide the full security audit report to the Commission, no later than 60 \ndays from the date of the issue of this direction; \nc. Rectify any security gaps identified in the security audit report, review and \nupdate its personal data protection policies as applicable within 60 days \nfrom the date the security audit report is provided; and  \nd.
