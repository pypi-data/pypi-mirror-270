Gillen, Jacob R. Grohs, Holly M. Matusovich, Gary R. Kirk \n Abstract \n Background \n Calls to improve learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and particularly engineering, present significant challenges for school systems. Partnerships among engineering industry, universities, and school systems to support learning appear promising, but current work is limited in its conclusions because it lacks a strong connection to theoretical work in interorganizational collaboration. \n  \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n This study aims to reflect more critically on the process of how organizations build relationships to address the following research question: In a public–private partnership to integrate engineering into middle school science curriculum, how do stakeholder characterizations of the collaborative process align with existing frameworks of interorganizational collaboration? \n  \n Design/Method \n This qualitative, embedded multiple case study considered in-depth pre- and post-year interviews with teachers, administrators, industry, and university personnel during the first year of the Partnering with Educators and Engineers in Rural Schools (PEERS) program. Transcripts were analyzed using a framework of interorganizational collaboration operationalized for our context. \n  \n Results \n Results provide insights into stakeholder perceptions of collaborative processes in the first year of the PEERS program across dimensions of collaboration. These dimensions mapped to three central discussion points with relevance for school–university–industry partnerships: school collaboration as an emergent and negotiated process, tension in collaborating across organizations, and fair share in collaborating toward a social goal. \n  \n Conclusions \n Taking a macro-level look at the collaborative processes involved enabled us to develop implications for collaborative stakeholders to be intentional about designing for future success. By systematically applying a framework of collaboration and capitalizing on the rich situational findings possible through a qualitative approach, we shift our understanding of collaborative processes in school–university–industry partnerships for engineering education and contribute to the development of collaboration theory. \n  \n "}], "ideal": ["In a public–private partnership to integrate engineering into middle school science curriculum, how do stakeholder characterizations of the collaborative process align with existing frameworks of interorganizational collaboration?"]}

A critical analysis of intercultural communication in engineering education \n Michael Handford, Jan Van Maele, Petr Matous, Yu Maemura \n Abstract \n Background \n It is increasingly acknowledged that technical expertise is not sufficient for engineers today, given the complex intercultural global contexts in which they are required to work. This article, therefore, examines how the concept of culture is typically operationalized in engineering education and discusses possible reasons for this approach. \n  \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n The specific research question explored here is 'How is culture conceptualized in engineering education?' \n  \n Design/Method \n To examine this previously unasked question, a mixed-methods methodology was developed, one that uses both quantitative and qualitative tools. More specifically, a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of relevant engineering education articles published in leading academic journals between 2000 and 2015 was combined with a close reading of each and a critical discussion of two representative articles. \n  \n Results \n Our findings reveal that, first, intercultural communication has not received the attention it deserves, given the multidisciplinary, diverse, global nature of the engineering profession. Furthermore, when intercultural concerns are discussed, the predominant approach is essentialist, meaning that culture is regarded as given (rather than constructed), framed in terms of differences between nations and potentially offering a causal explanation for individual behavior. This approach has been criticized for reinforcing stereotypical thinking and offering simplistic answers to complex problems. \n  \n Conclusions \n We conclude by exploring reasons for the relatively wide-spread acceptance of the “culture-as-given” approach in engineering education, then by urging educators to adopt a “small culture” approach for constructing culture in engineering, and finally by suggesting alternative ways for developing intercultural communicative competence. \n  \n "}], "ideal": ["How is culture conceptualized in engineering education?"]}

The aim of IEE is to train engineering students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. \n  \n Purpose \n We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses. This aim leads to two research questions: \n  \n What aspects of vision, teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical studies of IEE? \n  \n What points of attention regarding vision, teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as supporting or challenging IEE? \n  \n Scope/Method \n Ninety-nine studies published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis across studies.

Prior research has yet to investigate the differences in cognitive processes between spatial tasks in problem-solving to offer learners timely feedback. \n  \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n In this study, we investigated how different spatial tasks change the cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies used by engineering students with low spatial ability. \n  \n Design/Method \n Study participants completed mental rotation and mental cutting tasks of high and low difficulty.

However, no research has empirically tested the relationship between having socially oriented characteristics and being in managerial roles within the engineering profession, nor have gender differences been examined. \n  \n Purpose \n We test whether social interests and communal goal strivings are linked to engineers' positioning in managerial roles and explore gender as a moderator of these relationships.

Although flipped classes are a popular active methodology, there is a lack of high-quality studies assessing their impact in ecologically valid settings and exploring how outcomes are related to gender and to prior education. \n  \n Purpose \n This paper presents two modified replications of an experimental study investigating the impact of the flipped class approach on students' achievement in a large, first-year class in an engineering bachelor's degree. \n  \n Methodology \n We added a new strand, progressively flipped over 3 years, to eight parallel strands of a high-stakes mandatory linear algebra course for engineers.

The results highlight the need for more awareness of learner agency and more opportunities for students to enact learner agency by increasing PBL knowledge, skills, and efficacy. Q methodology can contribute to engineering education research by providing new theoretical and empirical insights into learners' subjective understanding of agency in a PBL setting as a complex system. \n  \n "}], "ideal": ["How do engineering students perceive their enactment of learner agency?

Barner, Shane Adam Brown, Floraliza Bornasal, David Linton \n Abstract \n Background \n Situated cognition theory suggests that representations of concepts are products of the environment wherein we learn and apply concepts. This research builds on situated cognition by investigating how concepts are tangible to a professional engineering environment. \n  \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n The tangibility of concepts in relation to social and material contexts was defined and explored in this study. Specifically, the conceptual representations of structural loads were examined within workplace and academic environments. \n  \n Design/Method \n A researcher conducted ethnographic fieldwork at a private engineering firm and in undergraduate engineering courses. Data sources from this fieldwork included the ethnographer's participant-observation field notes, formal and informal interviews, and artifact documentation. \n  \n Results \n Findings from this study described how academic representations of structural loads are more or less tangible to the social and material contexts of engineering practice. Representations documented in the workplace were found to be tangible to (1) real-world conditions, (2) project/stakeholder constraints, and (3) engineering tools. Conversely, representations documented in the courses studied exhibited various degrees of tangibility to none, some, or all of these three traits. \n  \n Conclusions \n These findings explicitly identify the ways in which representations of structural loads differ across academic and workplace environments and how these differences may contribute to the education–practice gap. Specific suggestions for making academic representations more tangible to workplace environments are provided based on findings from in the workplace, previous engineering education literature, and best practices observed in the courses studied. Future research considerations and the value of ethnographic methodology to situated cognition theory are also discussed. \n  \n "}], "ideal": ["How do academic representations of structural loads differ across academic and workplace environments?

Huerta, Adam R. Carberry, Teri Pipe, Ann F. McKenna \n Abstract \n Background \n There is clear consensus among influential education reports that an expansive range of intrapersonal (e.g., self-regulation) and interpersonal competencies (e.g., empathy) highly influence educational and career success. Research on teaching and learning these competencies is limited in engineering education. \n  \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n This study explores the impacts of a mindfulness training program on first-year engineering students and aims to understand potential impacts on the development of intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies. \n  \n Design/Method \n A four-session mindfulness-based program was designed, developed, and facilitated to cultivate intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies. Qualitative data were collected from a total of 35 students through a post-survey (n = 32), 3-month follow-up survey (n = 24), and interviews (n = 18). A thematic analysis process accompanied by validity and trustworthiness checks was employed to analyze the data. \n  \n Results \n The results suggest that the majority of students became more mindful, which led to improved intrapersonal competencies (e.g., self-regulation, focus, resilience, and well-being) and interpersonal competencies (e.g., empathy, communication, teamwork, and leadership). \n  \n Discussion/Conclusions \n The study provides compelling evidence that mindfulness training can support the development of intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies among engineering students, which can support their overall academic experience, personal, and professional development. Future design and development work will be needed to evaluate the integration and scalability potential of mindfulness training within engineering programs. \n  \n "}], "ideal": ["What are the impacts of a mindfulness training program on first-year engineering students?

Huff, Benjamin Okai, Kanembe Shanachilubwa, Nicola W. Sochacka, Joachim Walther \n Abstract \n Background \n Although prior research has provided robust descriptions of engineering students' identity development, a gap in the literature exists related to students' emotional experiences of shame, which undergird the socially constructed expectations of their professional formation. \n  \n Purpose \n We examined the lived experiences of professional shame among White male engineering students in the United States. We conceptualize professional shame to be a painful emotional state that occurs when one perceives they have failed to meet socially constructed expectations or standards that are relevant to their identity in a professional domain. \n  \n Method \n We conducted unstructured interviews with nine White male engineering students from both a research-focused institution and a teaching-focused institution. We used interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine the interview transcripts. \n  \n Results \n The findings demonstrated four themes related to how participants experienced professional shame. First, they negotiated their global, or holistic, identities in the engineering domain. Second, they experienced threats to their identities within professional contexts. Third, participants responded to threats in ways that gave prominence to the standards they perceived themselves to have failed. Finally, they repaired their identities through reframing shame experiences and seeking social connection. \n  \n Conclusions \n The findings demonstrate that the professional shame phenomenon is interwoven with professional identity development. In experiencing professional shame, White male students might reproduce the shame experience for themselves and others. This finding has important implications for the standards against which members from underrepresented groups may compare themselves and provides insight into the social construction of engineering cultures by dominant groups. \n  \n "}], "ideal": ["What are the lived experiences of professional shame among White male engineering students in the United States?

In fact, engineering education has been described as characterized by a 'culture of disengagement' in which ethical and societal concerns are constructed as different from and less important than purely technical concerns. \n  \n Purpose/Hypothesis \n This study explores how a culture of disengagement is discursively constructed and perpetuated in engineering education by analyzing the discursive construction of ethics and ethical reflection in an introductory engineering course in Sweden. \n  \n Design/Method \n The study is based on extensive ethnographic data in the form of field notes, lecture recordings, interview data, and course documents. The data are analyzed using a discourse analytic approach rooted in discourse theory. \n  \n Results \n The results illustrate five processes through which ethics and ethical reflection are articulated as not the responsibility of the specific field of engineering, irrelevant for the profession, of low quality and status, and not very important for the engineering degree. \n  \n Conclusions \n The results contribute to understanding how a culture of disengagement may be perpetuated in engineering education. The results also point toward pedagogical tools and strategies that instructors and program managers can use to construct ethics and ethical reflection as an advanced skill that is an important and integral part of engineering and engineering education—and thus better prepare future engineers to become responsible professionals. \n  \n "}], "ideal": ["How is a culture of disengagement discursively constructed in engineering education, particularly in regards to the construction of ethics and ethical reflection in an introductory engineering course in Sweden?"]}
