We will show that the statement \"every section $s : X \\to X$ of $f$ is equal to $f$\" is false by providing a counter-example.\n\nCounter-example: Let $X = \\{0,1\\}$ and define $f : X \\to X$ by $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 0$. Then $f$ is involutive, since $f(f(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(f(1)) = f(0) = 1$. \n\nNow, we will show that there are two sections of $f$: the identity function $id_X$ and $f$ itself. \n\nFirst, let $id_X : X \\to X$ be the identity function, defined by $id_X(x) = x$ for all $x \\in X$. We can see that $id_X$ is a section of $f$ by checking that $f(id_X(0)) = f(0) = 1$ and $f(id_X(1)) = f(1) = 0$, which implies that $id_X$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ id_X = id_X$.\n\nSecond, let $s : X \\to X$ be the function defined by $s(0) = 1$ and $s(1) = 0$. We can see that $s$ is also a section of $f$ by checking that $f(s(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(s(1)) = f(0) = 1$, which implies that $s$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ s = s$.\n\nHowever, $id_X$ and $f$ are not equal, since $id_X(0) = 0$ and $f(0) = 1$. Therefore, not every section of $f$ is equal to $f$. \n\nThus, we have shown that the statement \"every section $s : X \\to X$ of $f$ is equal to $f$\" is false by providing a counter-example.\nTEMPLATE CODE:\n```coq\nFrom Coq Require Import ssr.ssrfun.\n\nLemma counter_example : exists X (f : X -> X),\n  involutive f /\\\n  exists s : X -> X, cancel f s /\\ s <> f.\nProof.
