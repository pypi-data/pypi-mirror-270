As far as the verb forms you have studied so far are concerned, the following table summarises these. Only third person forms are shown, but the first and second forms can be deduced from these straightforwardly (e.g. like brisa she/he has, so also brisna I have and brisma you have, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n   consonant stems: dauk-    a-stems: aisa-    i-stems: bri- \n infinitive\n  daukaia\n    aisaia\n    briaia\n \n i-participle\n  dauki\n    aisi\n    bri\n \n present\n  daukisa\n    aisisa\n    brisa\n \n future\n  daukaisa\n    aisaisa\n    briaisa\n \n past\n  daukan\n    aisan\n    brin\n \n negative\n  daukras\n    aisaras\n    briras\n \n\n\n  \n\nThe full stem of each type of verb is best perceived in the negative, where -ras is always added directly to the stem. The final a of a-stems merges into the ending and disappears with endings that begin with an a or an i, such as the infinitive -aia, the participle -i, the present -isa, the future -aisa and so on. In the past (third person), -n is added to the stem (or the stem-final a merges into the ending -an, if you prefer to look at it that way). The final i of i-stems merges into endings that begin with an i (but the i is retained before other endings); in the past, -n (not -an) is added to the stem.\nOnly a very small number of verb belong to the a- and i-classes. The most common ones are:\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  aisa- speak\n wa- go\n bri- have\n di- drink\n pi- eat\n swi- leave, let, forget\n wi- say\n \n\n\n Notice that waia to go and wiaia to say have identical i-forms: wi. They also have similar present tenses (e.g. wisna I go or I say), but for \"I go\" it is more usual to find the irregular form auna, which you already know."}

Here we see that ra, which is the most common postposition in Miskito, can also have the meaning of \"to\", as in skul ra to school, tawan ra to the village, etc.\n\n\n\n Remembering that ra is sometime joined to the preceding word in writing, you should not be surprised when you read things like skulra, tawanra etc. We will follow this custom here only with very common combinations such as anira.\n\n\nWina is another postposition: it means \"from\", as in skul wina from school, sap wina from the shop and so on.\nHere we also see two important irregular verbs: auya goes, is going, go, are going and aula comes, is coming etc."}

It is hard to give an exact rule about which direct objects take ra and which do not, but simplifying we can give the rule of thumb: use ra with animate objects (i.e. people and animals). Therefore, Witin utla ba kaikisa He/She sees the house but Witin waitna ba ra kaikisa He/She sees the man.\n\n\n\n Notice that ra can come after nouns (aisiki ra), pronouns (witin ra) or determiners (waitna ba ra). The combination ba ra is often spelt bara.\n A special case is \"whom\" (\"who\" as direct object): ya + ra changes to yaura."}
{"title": "A note on infinitives", "content": "A note on infinitives\nFrom here onwards we shall follow the traditional custom of citing verbs in the infinitive. Miskito infinitives have the ending -aia. The infinitives of the verbs you know so far are:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n aisaia\n  to speak\n  →  aisisa\n  aisaras\n \n balaia\n  to come\n  →  aula\n  balras\n \n daukaia\n  to make, to do\n  →  daukisa\n  daukras\n \n inaia\n  to cry\n  →  inisa\n  inras\n \n iwaia\n  to sit\n  →  iwisa\n  iwras\n \n kaia\n  to be\n  →  sa\n  (apia sa)\n \n kaikaia\n  to see\n  →  kaikisa\n  kaikras\n \n piakaia\n  to cook\n  →  piakisa\n  piakras\n \n plikaia\n  to look for\n  →  plikisa\n  plikras\n \n pulaia\n  to play\n  →  pulisa\n  pulras\n \n waia\n  to go\n  →  auya\n  waras\n \n\n\nIn most cases we can obtain the verbs stem just by removing -aia, and to the resulting stem the regular endings (-isa, -ras etc.) are then added. Any exceptions will be noted as they arise. Notice in particular that the infinitive of the irregular verb \"to be\" (present: sa) is kaia!"}

Another way to produce the future is to remove the final -a from the infinitive and add, in its place, the present-tense forms of kaia, thus daukaia → daukai- → daukaisna, daukaisma, daukaisa.

In order to say I am doing, you are doing.., and also I do, you do..., the appropriate form of to be is placed after the i-form (e.g. dauki), and this gives us the regular present tense, with these endings:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n first person\n  -isna\n \n second person\n  -isma\n \n third person, yawan\n  -isa\n \n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n   daukaia do  kaikaia see  pulaia play  aisaia speak \n 1\n  daukisna\n  kaikisna\n  pulisna\n  aisisna\n \n 2\n  daukisma\n  kaikisma\n  pulisma\n  aisisma\n \n 3, yawan\n  daukisa\n  kaikisa\n  pulisa\n  aisisa\n \n\n\n The compound verbs wark takaia to work and lan takaia to learn are formed from the borrowings from English wark (\"work\") and lan (\"learn\") and the Miskito verb takaia.

Kalila wîna baman pisa.\nKARLA: Utla ra kalila kum kum brisma ki?\nMARIA: Apia, yang kalila kum sin briras.\n \n\n\nAs we saw earlier, the form of verbs in -ras is a negative participle. The various tenses and persons can be expressed in the negative by placing the corresponding form of kaia after -ras, so for example the negative present tense of daukaia to do (next to the affirmative for comparison) is:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n   AFFIRMATIVE\n  NEGATIVE\n \n 1\n  daukisna\n  daukras sna\n \n 2\n  daukisma\n  daukras sma\n \n 3, yawan\n  daukisa\n  daukras sa\n \n\n\nWe can also use other tenses of kaia to form the corresponding negative tenses. However, the auxiliary kaia may be omitted leaving just the -ras-form; the intended person and tense must then be inferred from the context.\n\n\n\n Remember: kaia itself has no -ras-form; apia is placed in front of the affirmative forms to make them negative: apia sna/sma/sa. The same holds for compounds with kaia such as want kaia, nu kaia etc.: want apia sna and so on.\n The verbs piaia eat and briaia have belong to a special class: present pisna, brisna etc., negative priras, briras."}

There is also a compound past tense, the imperfect, formed by placing the past tense of kaia (kan in the third person) after the i-participle: puli kan, atki kan, kaiki kan.\n\n\n\n The i-form of verbs is already familiar to you as the base of the present tense of regular verbs, so if you remove the ending -sa from the present pulisa what you are left with is the verb's i-form: puli.\n\n\nThe imperfect can often be translated by was playing, was buying etc. (or by the imperfect tense in Spanish, French etc., if you know a Romance language: thus puli kan is equivalent to jugaba, jouait and so on). The imperfect usually expresses an ongoing activity whereas the simple past expresses a specific act.\nThe negative past is formed as you would now expect: the verb's -ras-form plus the past of kaia (kan in the third person): pulras kan. But once again, the auxiliary may be omitted: pulras.\n\n\n\n Compound kaia-verbs (want kaia, nu kaia etc.) form the past, as we would expect, using the past of kaia, e.g. want kan wanted, nu kan knew, want apia kan didn't want etc."}

Thus man you (talking to one person), man nani you (talking to more than one person).\nSo also with yang, but yang nani expresses \"we\" in the exclusive sense of \"I and these other people (but not you)\". We have already learnt that inclusive \"we\", i.e. when also including the person addressed, is yawan. In a sense, then, we may say that there are seven \"persons\" in Miskito, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n   singular\n    plural\n \n 1 inclusive\n  —\n    yawan\n \n 1 exclusive\n  yang\n    yang nani\n \n 2\n  man\n    man nani\n \n 3\n  witin\n    witin nani\n \n\n\n In fact we also sometimes encounter yawan nani, apparently to emphasise the notion of plurality, as in the sentence: Yawan nani sut ba Miskitu nani sa We are all Miskitos (i.e. including you).\n\n\nThere are no special plural verb forms. The form for each singular person is also used for the corresponding plural person, e.g. in the present -isna for \"I\" and \"we (exc.)\", -isma for \"you\" both singular and plural, and (as you already know) -isa for \"she, he\" or \"they\". As you also already know, yawan takes the same verb form as the third person. So for example the full present tense of aisaia to speak is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n   singular\n    plural\n \n 1 inclusive\n  —\n    yawan aisisa\n \n 1 exclusive\n  yang aisisna\n    yang nani aisisna\n \n 2\n  man aisisma\n    man nani aisisma\n \n 3\n  witin aisisa\n    witin nani aisisa\n \n\n\n  \n\nThese principles apply to all verbs in all tenses."}

In such cases it is possible to indicate that the subject is plural (e.g. \"we\", not \"I\") using a different procedure: the auxiliary verb banghwaia. This auxiliary serves simply to indicate that the subject of the main verb is plural. When thus used, banghwaia takes whatever ending you would expect the verb to take depending on the person, tense etc. The main verb precedes bangwaia and adopts the invariable i-form. For example, the present tense of aisaia can also be given as follows (omitting the subject pronouns):\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n   singular\n    plural\n \n 1 exclusive\n  aisisna\n    aisi banghwisna\n \n 2\n  aisisma\n    aisi banghwisma\n \n 3\n  aisisa\n    aisi banghwisa\n \n\n\n In Miskito auxiliary verbs always follow the main verb.\n\n\nSo also:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n   singular\n    plural\n \n Present (third person)\n  daukisa\n    dauki banghwisa\n  make(s), is/are making \n Future (third person)\n  daukaisa\n    dauki banghwaisa\n  will make, is/are going to make \n Past (third person)\n  daukan\n    dauki banghwan\n  made \n Negative\n  daukras\n    dauki banghwras\n  doesn't/don't make, isn't/aren't making etc.\n \n\n\nand even with compound tenses, e.g.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n   singular\n    plural\n \n Imperfect (third person)\n  dauki kan\n    dauki banghwi kan\n  was/were making \n Negative past (third person)\n  daukras kan\n    dauki banghwras kan\n  didn't make, wasn't/weren't making \n\n\n Observe the order of auxiliaries in such cases.\n The verb kaia to be does not have an i-form."}
