{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: INCREASES FUNDING SOURCES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES BY CHANGING TAX ASSESSMENT OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT \n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\nThe text of this measure can be found on the Secretary of State's website at voterguide.sos.ca.gov. \u2022 Increases funding sources for K-12 public schools, community colleges, and local governments by requiring commercial and industrial real property be taxed based on current market value, instead of purchase price. \u2022 Exempts from taxation changes: residential properties; agricultural land; and owners of commercial and industrial properties with combined value of $3 million or less. Any additional education funding will supplement existing school funding guarantees. \u2022 Exempts small businesses from personal property tax; for other businesses, provides $500,000 exemption. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Increased property taxes on commercial properties worth more than $3 million providing $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion in new funding to local governments and schools.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nLocal Governments Tax Property. California cities, counties, schools, and special districts (such as a fire protection district) collect property taxes from property owners based on the value of their property. Property taxes raise around $65 billion each year for these local governments. Overall, about 60 percent of property taxes go to cities, counties, and special districts. The other 40 percent goes to schools and community colleges. These shares are different in different counties. \n\nProperty Includes Land, Buildings, Machinery, and Equipment. Property taxes apply to many kinds of property. Land and buildings are taxed. Businesses also pay property taxes on most other things they own. This includes equipment, machinery, computers, and furniture. We call these things \"business equipment.\" \n\nHow Is a Property Tax Bill Calculated? Each property owner's annual property tax bill is equal to the taxable value of their property multiplied by their property tax rate. The typical property owner's property tax rate is 1.1 percent. \n\nTaxable Value of Land and Buildings Is Based on Original Purchase Price. In the year a piece of land or a building is purchased, its taxable value typically is its purchase price. Each year after that, the property's taxable value is adjusted for inflation by up to 2 percent. When a property is sold again, its taxable value is reset to its new purchase price. The taxable value of most land and buildings is less than what they could be sold for. This is because the price most properties could be sold for grows faster than 2 percent per year. \n\nTaxable Value of Business Equipment Is Based on How Much It Could Be Sold for. Unlike land and buildings, business equipment is taxed based on how much it could be sold for today. \n\nCounties Manage the Property Tax. County assessors determine the taxable value of property. County tax collectors bill property owners. County auditors distribute tax revenue to local governments. Statewide, counties spend about $800 million each year on these activities. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nTax Commercial and Industrial Land and Buildings Based on How Much They Could Be Sold for. The measure requires commercial and industrial (after this referred to simply as \"commercial\") land and buildings to be taxed based on how much they could be sold for instead of their original purchase price. This change is put in place over time starting in 2022. The change does not start before 2025 for properties used by California businesses that meet certain rules and have 50 or fewer employees. Housing and agricultural land continues to be taxed based on its original purchase price. Some Lower Value Properties Not Included. This change does not apply if the owner has $3 million or less worth of commercial land and buildings in California djusted for inflation every two years). These properties continue to be taxed based on original purchase price. Reduce Taxes on Business Equipment. The measure reduces the taxable value of each business's equipment by $500,000 starting in 2024. Businesses with less than $500,000 of equipment pay no taxes on those items. All property taxes on business equipment are eliminated for California businesses that meet certain rules and have 50 or fewer employees. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nIncreased Taxes on Commercial Land and Buildings. Most owners of commercial land and buildings worth more than $3 million would pay higher property taxes. Only some of these property owners would start to pay higher taxes in 2022. By 2025, most of these property owners would pay higher taxes. Beginning in 2025, total property taxes from commercial land and buildings probably would be $8 billion to $12.5 billion higher in most years. The value of commercial property can change a lot from year to year. This means the amount of increased property taxes also could change a lot from year to year. Decreased Taxes on Business Equipment. Property taxes on business equipment probably would be several hundred million dollars lower each year. Money Set Aside to Pay Costs of the Measure. The measure sets aside money for various costs created by the measure. This includes giving several hundred million dollars per year to counties to pay for their costs of carrying out the measure. The measure would increase the amount of work county assessors do and could require changes in how they do their work. Counties could have costs from the measure before new money is available to cover these costs. The state would loan money to counties to cover these initial costs until new property tax revenue is available. New Funding for Local Governments and Schools. Overall, $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion per year in new property taxes would go to local governments. 60 percent would go to cities, counties, and special districts. Each city, county, or special district's share of the money depends on several things including the amount of new taxes paid by commercial properties in that community. Not all governments would be guaranteed new money. Some in rural areas may end up losing money because of lower taxes on business equipment. The other 40 percent would increase funding for schools and community colleges. Each school or community college's share of the money is mostly based on how many students they have.

Initiative StatUTE. * 32 * Prepared by the Attorney General \u2022 Allows persons who are legally eligible to vote and have valid identification to register to vote on election day at their polling place. \u2022 Increases criminal penalty for voter and voter registration fraud. \u2022 Criminalizes conspiracy to commit voter fraud. \u2022 Requires trained staff at polling places to manage election day registration, creates fund to implement measure, including training and providing personnel for election day registration. \u2022 Allows persons to register or reregister during 28 days preceding election day at local election offices. \u2022 Provides more time to county election officials to prepare voter registration lists. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Annual state costs of about $6 million to fund counties for election day voter registration activities, thereby resulting in no anticipated net county cost. Title and Summary \u2022 Minor state administrative costs and unknown, but probably minor, state costs to enforce a new election fraud offense. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUnder current law, Californians who want to vote in an upcoming election must register with county elections officials by the 15th day before the election. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nElection Day Registration. This measure allows eligible citizens, upon presenting proof of current residence, to register up to and including election day. Under the measure, citizens registering on or after the 28th day before an election must do so at the county elections office, or at a polling place on election day. Local elections officials must provide a separate area and at least one trained staff member at each polling place for election day voter registration. Additionally, the Secretary of State must include information about election day voter registration as part of all voter education efforts. Election Day Registration Fund. This measure establishes the \"Election Day Registration Fund\" within the State Treasury. Each year, approximately $6 million would be deposited into this fund from the state's General Fund and distributed to counties for their costs ELECTION DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. VOTER FRAUD PENALTIES. INITIATIVE STATUTE. For text of Proposition 52 see page 98. PROP 52 of election day voter registration including hiring and training additional personnel, providing voter registration materials, and expanding voter outreach programs. Counties receiving money from the fund would be required to submit an annual report identifying their expenditures. Increased Penalties for Voter Fraud. This measure increases the penalties for fraudulent registration or voting activity. It also creates a new crime of conspiracy of two or more people who commit specified election fraud, punishable by imprisonment in state prison. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nThis measure annually appropriates $6 million (adjusted for cost-of-living increases) from the state's General Fund for the county costs of election day voter registration activities. As a result, no net costs to counties are anticipated. Analysis The Secretary of State would incur minor costs to carry out the requirements of this measure. The state also would incur, unknown, but probably minor, criminal justice costs for individuals who commit a newly established election fraud offense. \n\nARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52\n\nPROP 52 PROTECTS YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE AND PROTECTS AGAINST VOTER FRAUD. Every California citizen who is legally eligible should be able to vote on election day. Anyone who tries to vote illegally should be stopped and prosecuted. Presently, California law makes it nearly impossible for some citizens to vote-and too easy for others to commit voter fraud. Prop 52 ensures that every eligible citizen has the opportunity to vote, and increases penalties for voter fraud. Prop 52 will: ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52 \u2022 Give all legally eligible citizens the right to vote on election day. \u2022 Allow legally eligible citizens to register and vote on election day only with a valid California driver's license or two required forms of identification proving they are California residents voting at the right polling place. \u2022 Double the penalties for voting illegally or for voter fraud. \u2022 Provide training to election day poll workers on processing voter registrations and preventing voter fraud. PROP 52 PREVENTS VOTER FRAUD. Under current state law, there's no requirement to show identification when registering to vote. Voter fraud laws are too weak and need to be strengthened. Currently county elections officials aren't required to report voter fraud to law enforcement officials. The existing system has loopholes that have even allowed pets to be registered as voters! Vote Yes on 52. Prop 52 protects against voter fraud by: \u2022 Making conspiracy to commit voter fraud a felony, punishable by a long jail sentence. \u2022 Requiring county elections officials to report fraudulent voting activities to the District Attorney. \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52\n\nDon't be fooled. Prop. 52 is full of loopholes that corrupt our election process and will lead to widespread voter fraud. That's why Law Enforcement leaders like Contra Costa County District Attorney Gary Yancey, Ventura County District Attorney Mike Bradbury, Shasta County District Attorney McGregor Scott and Santa Barbara County Sheriff Jim Thomas all say NO on 52. FACT: Prop. 52 makes it easier for CRIMINALS and NON-CITIZENS to vote. That's not fair to qualified voters who follow the rules. FACT: Prop. 52 does not require a drivers license or other government identification to register and vote on Election Day. Under Prop. 52, a piece of junk mail is considered one of the valid forms of ID! 34 * FACT: Hidden in the fine print is a change in the law that makes proving FRAUD almost impossible. The authors of Proposition 52 are trying to fool you with talk of tough penalties. Tough penalties mean nothing if it's impossible to prove the crime was committed. Arguments Requiring unregistered voters who want to vote on election day to prove they are eligible by showing a valid California driver's license or two required forms of identification proving they are California residents voting at the right polling place. Requiring all polling places to clearly display both the rights of voters and the new penalties for voter fraud. \"Prop 52 will give law enforcement the vital new tools we need to deter and prevent voter fraud.\"-Grover Trask, Riverside County District Attorney PROP 52 PROTECTS YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE. Today in the U.S., only 49% of eligible voters vote. For the world's greatest democracy, that's pitiful. We should do everything possible to get more eligible citizens to the polls. The League of Women Voters of California, the California Professional Firefighters, and the California Nurses Association have all endorsed Prop 52 because they understand the importance of increasing voter turnout. Currently, outdated quirks in state law prevent many eligible citizens from voting on election day. For example, those who turn 18 or move a few weeks before an election could be deprived of the right to vote. States with laws like Prop 52 lead the nation in voter turnout. The anti-fraud provisions in Prop 52 provide vitally needed new protections against voter fraud. \"Our study shows that election day registration holds enormous promise. It is an easier way to vote. In California, Prop 52 should produce substantially higher voter turnout.\"-Mike Alvarez, Ph.D., Caltech LEE BACA Los Angeles County Sheriff MARCH FONG EU Former Secretary of State FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52 FACT: 44 other states wisely DO NOT ALLOW Election Day registration. \"Prop. 52 would bilk taxpayers $6 million yearly for a program that allows dishonest politicians to steal elections.\"- Richard Gann, President, Gann Taxpayer Organization Remember Florida? Don't let it happen here. Other states are moving to tighten their laws against election fraud. Prop. 52 sends California in the opposite direction. The backers of Prop. 52 are trying to fool you. Don't let them get away with it. VOTE NO on 52\u2014PROTECT YOUR VOTE. VOTE NO on 52-STOP ELECTION FRAUD. HONORABLE ED JAGELS District Attorney of Kern County ROY BURNS, President Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs JILL SCHALL, President Women Prosecutors of California \n\nARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 52 \n\nProposition 52 makes it easier for CRIMINALS, DISHONEST POLITICIANS and NON-CITIZENS to commit ELECTION FRAUD. That's why District Attorneys, Sheriffs, Cops, and Elections Officials across California urge you to VOTE NO on 52. Prop. 52 appears well intentioned, until you read the fine print. This poorly drafted measure is full of LOOPHOLES and HIDDEN AGENDAS that will lead to MASSIVE ELECTION FRAUD in California. It's a classic example of a cure that is worse than the disease. PROP. 52 DOES NOT REQUIRE PHOTO IDENTIFICATION. California already has one of the most liberal elections laws in the nation. Registration forms are widely available and county elections officials have only 15 days to check for fraud and prepare voter rolls. But under Prop. 52, a person could register and cast a ballot on Election Day with \"identification\" that is nothing more than any piece of mail addressed to a udent lease agreement, credit card bill, or other unofficial identification. No photo ID would be required. em If Proposition 52 passes, elections officials will have no way of knowing if the person suddenly registering on Election Day is entitled to vote, or, for that matter, even a citizen of the United States. And they will have no time to check the validity of the registration before the ballot is cast. PROP. 52 MAKES IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT FRAUD AND OVERTURN ELECTIONS WON WITH PHONY VOTES. Under Prop. 52, ballots cast by those registering on Election Day will be mixed together with all other ballots. There will be no way for law enforcement and elections officials to go back after Election Day and determine if an ection was won by frau penalties against election fraud contained in Prop. 52 are useless, because the measure makes it impossible to ever prove the crime! District Attorneys, Sheriffs, Cops and Elections Officials OPPOSE Prop. 52. So do Republicans, Democrats, Labor and Taxpayer Groups. Working Californians OPPOSE Prop. 52. Our right to have our vote counted in fair elections will no longer exist in California if this measure passes. Forty-four other states wisely do not allow Election Day registration. PROP The six small states with laws similar to Prop. 52 are not like California. Our state is too big, and the potential for abuse too high, to enact a law that makes it easier to commit fraud. In a typical election, almost half of legally registered voters choose not to vote. Making it easier for FELONS, NON- CITIZENS AND OTHERS NOT QUALIFIED TO VOTE TO COMMIT FRAUD, will not solve the problem of low turn out.   In the wake of the controversy and chaos surrounding the 2000 Election in Florida, other states are looking to improve election laws and crack down on vote fraud. California must not go in the other direction by opening the door to fraud and election abuse. \u2022 PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY of our election system \u2022 PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE in fair elections \u2022 STOP ELECTION FRAUD \u2022 Vote NO on PROP. 52! HONORABLE JAN SCULLY District Attorney of Sacramento County HONORABLE MIKE CARONA Sheriff of Orange County SHARON RUNNER, Co-Chair Citizens & Law Enforcement Against Election Fraud  \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 52 \n\nAfter the 2000 Presidential election people understood \"One vote can make a difference.\" Politics aside, one thing is clear-we need to protect our right to vote and ensure everyone who is eligible to vote-CAN VOTE! That's what Election Day Voter Registration does. States with election day registration lead the nation in turnout. A Cal-Tech/MIT election study found, \"California will experience an even larger increase in turnout...as much as one million new voters.\" A bipartisan group of elections experts wrote this law with protections making the process fair and convenient; with stiff penalties for politicians who try to steal elections. Prop 52 requires training for poll workers, requires allegations of fraud be reported to prosecutors and doubles the fines for fraud. ELECTION DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. VOTER FRAUD PENALTIES. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Misleading claims that Prop 52 will cause rampant fraud and allow unscrupulous individuals to cast several ballots just don't ring true. Opponents neglect to remind you that currently, you don't have to show ID when registering to vote or voting. Prop 52 adds new, strict identification requirements for election day registration: a photo I\u010e, or two forms of legally valid ID showing that the voter is voting in the correct precinct. BARBARA INATSUGU, President League of Women Voters of California ROCKY DELGADILLO Los Angeles City Attorney Politicians and bureaucrats claim that any reform will crash the system-the same arguments made about Motor Voter, Absentee Voting, and Campaign Finance Reform. But they all work. We can complain about California's low voter turnout or we can pass Prop 52-reform that will make a difference.
