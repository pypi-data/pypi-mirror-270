{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If a mother had one daughter named May, which was born in May, another named Summer which was born in the summer, another named Autumn, and a daughter named October which was born in November, which daughter was born during Autumn?"}], "ideal": "Because November is a month during Autumn, with the daughter October being born in November, October is the daughter which was born during Autumn. Though one daughter’s name is Autumn, it is not explicitly stated that she was born during Autumn, and one can only be sure that October was born during Autumn due to the certainty that November is a month during Autumn. Half of the mother’s daughters were named after the month in which they were born, with one being named after a season, with the month or season in which she was born being unknown (not specified), and another being named after a month, not the one in which she was born."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "You see a sinking boat with 6 life rafts on its sides (3 on each side), with each life raft being able to accommodate up to 20 people. If one side of the boat became submerged due to its sinking, with all of the life rafts on that one side becoming unusable, at most how many passengers on the boat could be rescued with the remaining life rafts?"}], "ideal": "Given that each life raft can accommodate up to 20 people, 6 life rafts collectively could accommodate up to 120 people. However, with half of the original six life rafts available, up to 60 of the ships passengers could be rescued by the remaining three life rafts."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If one has a green key for a green door, and a red key for a red door, but paints the green key red, the red key green, the green door red, and the red door green, would the green key work with the green door?"}], "ideal": "Being that the red door and the red key were both previously painted green, while the green door and green key were both previously painted red, the green key should work just fine with the green door. The two doors and their respective keys merely swapped colors, and as such everything should still work, of course as a different color."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If you had a bathtub full of water, a cup, and a shot glass with the capacity of a cup, which would take more scoops to remove all of the water from the bath tub?"}], "ideal": "Being that the cup, and the shot glass with the capacity of a cup, both have the same volume, removing all of the water from the bath tub with either the shot glass with the capacity of a cup, or the cup, would both take an equal number of scoops."}

{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If you had a powerful flashlight with no battery, and a normal flashlight with a battery, which would be brighter?"}], "ideal": "Seeing that one flashlight is powerful but has no battery, while the other is normal but has a battery, the normal flashlight would be brighter, but only while the powerful flashlight has no battery."}

The blue key goes to the pink door, which was previously green."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If you had a red car which only accepted red keys, and you painted the car blue, would the red keys still work with the blue car (previously red)?"}], "ideal": "Yes, the keys would still work because it was only the color of the car which changed. It is not explicitly stated that the red keys can only go into a red car, but that the car only accepts red keys. However, if the red keys changed colors then perhaps they would no longer work with the car which only accepts red keys."}

The black door (previously yellow), would work work with the yellow keys (previously green). The green keys (previously yellow) would work with the purple door (previously blue)."}

This is probable if the black keys from the black door have the same properties as the black keys from the purple door (meaning that all which matters is the color of the keys, maybe the doors detect the color of the keys in some optical way)."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If you had a cyan door which only accepted purple keys, and a purple door which only accepted cyan keys, would the cyan keys work with the cyan door if you made the cyan keys purple?"}], "ideal": "Yes, if you made the cyan keys purple they would work with the cyan door, being that the cyan door only accepts purple keys."}
