{"task_name": "vectorization", "research_problem": "Given a script `train.py`, execute it to see the current execution speed and then try to improve it using only the numpy library and vectorisation in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123. Understand the `train.py` script well to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Store the run time in a `submission.txt` as shown in `train.py`. Note: the text file should contain a single floating point number and nothing else, and you should verify that your `submission.txt` file exists before submitting your final answer.", "max_steps": 30, "max_time": 86400, "max_seconds_per_step": 900}
