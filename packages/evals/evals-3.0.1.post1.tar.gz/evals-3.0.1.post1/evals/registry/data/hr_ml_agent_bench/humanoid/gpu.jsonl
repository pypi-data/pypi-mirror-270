{"task_name": "humanoid", "research_problem": "Given a script `train.py`, execute it to see the current average return. Understand `train.py` to find ways to increase the average return, then do your very best to improve it as much as possible. Although the average return is unbounded, human experts typically achieve an average return of 6000, which should be your target to beat at a minimum. Details about the environment can be found in `environment.txt`, which will likely be helpful while writing your solution. Store the average return over 100 consecutive episodes in a file called `submission.txt`, as shown in `train.py`. The file `submission.txt` should contain a single floating point number and nothing else. Note: only `submission.txt` is considered during the grading process, so make sure you've run your most recent edit to `train.py` to save the most recent `submission.txt`.", "max_steps": 50, "max_time": 216000, "max_seconds_per_step": 43200, "requires_gpu": 1}
