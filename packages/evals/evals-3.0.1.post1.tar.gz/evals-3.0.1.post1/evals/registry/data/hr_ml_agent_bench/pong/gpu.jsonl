{"task_name": "pong", "research_problem": "Given a script `train.py`, execute it to see the current average return. Understand `train.py` to find ways to increase the average return, then do your very best to achieve the maximum possible average return: 21. Details about the environment can be found in `environment.txt`, which will likely be helpful while writing your solution. Store the average return over 20 consecutive episodes in a file called `submission.txt`, as shown in `train.py`. The file `submission.txt` should contain a single floating point number and nothing else. Note: only `submission.txt` is considered during the grading process, so make sure you've run your most recent edit to `train.py` to save the most recent `submission.txt`.", "max_steps": 50, "max_time": 126000, "max_seconds_per_step": 25200, "requires_gpu": 1}
