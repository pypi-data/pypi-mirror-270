def preprocess_credit_score_data(df):
    """
    Function to preprocess the credit score classification DataFrame. This function performs multiple tasks:
    1. Removes columns that are unlikely to have predictive power ('ID', 'Customer_ID', 'Name', 'SSN').
    2. Cleans specific columns by removing non-numeric characters and converting them to float type.
    3. Processes the 'Type_of_Loan' column to create binary features for each loan type.
    4. Extracts the number of years from 'Credit_History_Age' and converts it to a float.

    Parameters:
    df (DataFrame): The credit score classification DataFrame to be preprocessed.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: The preprocessed DataFrame.
