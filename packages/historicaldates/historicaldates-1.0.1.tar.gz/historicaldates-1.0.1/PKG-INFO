# python-historical-dates

Python library for handling historical dates, including support for BCE dates. This library simplifies working with ancient and historical calendars without the complexities of modern datetime modules.

## Features

- Support for both BCE and CE dates.
- Simple and intuitive API for creating and manipulating historical dates.
- Functionality for comparing dates and calculating differences across eras.

## Installation

Install `python-historical-dates` via pip:

```bash
pip install historicaldates
```

## Quick Start

Here's how you can use python-historical-dates to create and manipulate historical dates:

```python
from historicaldates import HistoricalDate

# Create a historical date for January 1, 500 BCE
date_bce = HistoricalDate(-500, 1, 1)

# Create a historical date for December 31, 500 CE
date_ce = HistoricalDate(500, 12, 31)

# Calculate the number of days between two dates
days_between = date_ce - date_bce
print(f"Days between: {days_between}")
```
