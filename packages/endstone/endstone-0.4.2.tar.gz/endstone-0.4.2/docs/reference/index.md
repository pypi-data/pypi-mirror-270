# Reference

In the course of your plugin development, you may choose between the Python API and C++ API. If you are seeking a
quick start and prefer a more flexible language, the Python API documentation can be your starting point. However,
if you need to implement more performance-driven, highly optimized code, you may want to delve into the C++ API
documentation.
