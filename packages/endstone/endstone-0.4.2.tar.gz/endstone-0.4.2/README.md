## 📖 Introduction [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

We are excited to announce the Endstone project. Endstone offers a plugin API for Bedrock Dedicated Servers, supporting
both Python and C++ languages. This allows developers to enhance Bedrock Dedicated Servers with various features and
functionalities.

## 🎯 Features [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

- **Cross-platform**: We have dedicated efforts to support both Windows and Linux. Proudly, we are the only
  BDS-based server software sporting native support for both platforms without the need for an emulator.
- **Feature-rich**: All up-to-date Minecraft features are at your fingertips! We make sure to keep Endstone aligned with
  the latest game updates.
- **Hassle-free**: Ready to use right out of the box. Start the Endstone server with just one line of command. No extra
  tools required.
- **High-level API**: We provide a high-level friendly API akin to Bukkit plugin developers. Save yourself the hassle of
  dealing with the dot-and-cross of the low-level system API and hooks, we've done the difficult part for you!
- **Starter-friendly**: No C++ knowledge? No problem! Craft your plugins using Python, your favourite.
- **Performance-in-mind**: For the performance savants, you can, of course, write (or rewrite) your plugins in C++ to
  squeeze out
  every bit of performance.

## 🛠️ Get started [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

Before getting started, verify that you are using one of the following compatible operating systems:

- Windows 10 version 10.0.15063 or later
- Windows Server 2016 or later
- Debian 11 or later
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later

Please also ensure you have **Python 3.9 or higher** installed on your system.

There are several ways to install Endstone:

### 🐍 PyPi

Endstone can be installed directly from PyPi using pip. Open your terminal and execute the following command to install
and start
the Endstone server:

```shell
pip install endstone
endstone
```

### 🐳 Docker

To try Endstone from the latest Docker image, use the following command:

```shell
docker pull endstone/endstone
docker run --rm -it -p 19132:19132/udp endstone/endstone
```

This will pull the latest Endstone image and run it interactively in your terminal.

### 🕋 Docker Compose

You can also use Docker Compose to run Endstone in a production environment.

```shell
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker attach endstone
```

### 🔨 Build locally from Source

For advanced users, you may build Endstone locally from the source.

**Please note that building from source requires toolchains to be installed on your system.**

First, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone.git
cd endstone
```

The Endstone project uses Conan as the package manager. The next step will involve the installation of conan and
dependencies.

```shell
pip install conan
conan export third_party/funchook --version 1.1.3
conan install . --build=missing -s compiler.cppstd=17 -c tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:generator=Ninja
```

Finally, you can build the wheel and install it on your local machine:

```shell
pip install .
endstone
```

## 🌟 Plugins [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

Currently, the Endstone project is under active development, and we invite you to review our roadmap. While you wait,
why not take a sneaky peek of our example plugins which illustrate the friendliness of the plugin API. If you have
previous experience with Bukkit, you should find the API particularly intuitive to work with:
