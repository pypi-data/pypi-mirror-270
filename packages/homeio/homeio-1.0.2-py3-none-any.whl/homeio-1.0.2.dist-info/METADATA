# Virtual Home Control with Home IO

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install homeio-control
```

## Usage

To use this package, simply import the relevant classes into your Python code:

```python
from homeio_control import HomeIOConnection, Light

# Create a connection to the Home IO server
connection = HomeIOConnection()

# Control a light
living_room_light = Light(connection, "S")

# Turn on the living room light
living_room_light.turn_on()

# Turn off the living room light
living_room_light.turn_off()
```

This is a basic example for controlling a light. You can control other devices in the same way using the appropriate classes.

home_io_port: 9797
```
