**BARO** is an end-to-end anomaly detection and root cause analysis approach for microservices's failures. This repository includes artifacts for reuse and reproduction of experimental results presented in our FSE'24 paper titled _"BARO: Robust Root Cause Analysis for Microservices via Multivariate Bayesian Online Change Point Detection"_.


## Installation

Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install fse-baro
```

Or, build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phamquiluan/baro.git && cd baro
pip install -e .
```

BARO has been tested on Linux and Windows, with different Python versions. More details are in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## How-to-use

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1znckFNPny9zU0Rlc9_Q99E6h3hsJq764?usp=sharing)


```python
import pandas as pd 
from baro.anomaly_detection import bocpd
from baro.root_cause_analysis import robust_scorer
from baro.utility import download_data, read_csv

# download a sample data to data.csv
download_data()

# read data, perform anomaly detection and rca using bocpd and robust_scorer
data = read_csv("data.csv")
anomalies = bocpd(data)  # data format and visualization are described in the Colab notebook above.
root_causes = robust_scorer(data, anomalies=anomalies)
print(root_causes)

# reproducibility
TODO: add reproducibility
```

## Download Paper

TBD

## Download Datasets

Our datasets are publicly available in Zenodo repository with the following information:

- Dataset DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11046533.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11046533)
- Dataset URL: https://zenodo.org/records/11046533

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the performance of our BARO, we have prepared two Google Colab Notebooks as follows,
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/120svKTl53cK8KId1rFSrw0BOqnReMB0j?usp=sharing): This notebook reproduces the RCA performance of BARO (also at [tutorials/reproducibility.ipynb](https://github.com/phamquiluan/baro/blob/main/tutorials/reproducibility.ipynb)).
2. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TObicUGcP9Z9xqML-iJxDo_Vlttp1Lpm?usp=sharing): This nodebook reproduces the output of the Multivariate BOCPD module.
