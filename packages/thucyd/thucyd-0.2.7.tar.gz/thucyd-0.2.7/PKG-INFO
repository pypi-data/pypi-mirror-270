## What is `thucyd`?

`thucyd` (thoo'-sid) delivers a reference implementation of advanced eigenanalysis tools. When more performant libraries are created (elsewhere) then they can use this version as a golden source. 

See [A consistently oriented basis for eigenanalysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41060-020-00227-z) (2020) in the _International Journal of Data Science and Analytics_ and [A Consistently Oriented Basis for Eigenanalysis: Improved Directional Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08139) (2024) in _arXiv_ for details of the functions provided in `thucyd`.


## Package Installation

The two package hosts for `thucyd` are [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/thucyd/) and [Conda-Forge](). The packages are identical and the only difference is the means of delivery. From PyPi, use `pip`,

```bash
$ pip install thucyd
```

and from Conda-Forge use `conda`:

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge thucyd
```

Once installed, the package is importable to Python:

```python
>>> import thucyd
```

A quick example call to the `eigen` subpackage would be

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> V = np.eye(3).dot(np.diag([1., -1., 1.]))
>>> E = np.arange(3)[::-1]
>>> Vor, Eor, signs, thetas, _ = thucyd.eigen.orient_eigenvectors(V, E)
>>> Vor
array([[1., 0., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 1.]])
>>> signs
array([ 1., -1.,  1.])
```


## Package Dependency

The only dependencies `thucyd` has at this time is on [python >= 3.7](https://www.python.org/) and [numpy >= 1.23](https://www.numpy.org/). 


## About `thucyd`

[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) was the first Western writer and historian who applied scientific principles to the recording of Western history. Although Herodotus, who predates Thucydides by less than a generation, started the transformation away from the epic poetry enshrined by Homer to a more objective record, it was Thucydides who engaged in inquiry and cross validation of all accounts in his History of the Peloponnesian Wars.
