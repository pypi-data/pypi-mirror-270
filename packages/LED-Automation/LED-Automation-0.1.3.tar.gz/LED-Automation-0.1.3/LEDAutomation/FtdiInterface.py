# General Notes on code:
# a 1 bit is considered HIGH/UP/ACTIVE and a 0 bit is considered LOW/DOWN/INACTIVE in relation to documentation and schematics
# Register addresses are found in the documentation for the device that is controlling the LED's: in our case the PCA9506 chip
# Which pins on the chip that need to be used to toggle the LED's is located on the schematic for the board. This also shows which IO bank on the chip has the LED pins (IO_4 aka bank 4)

#General Flow:

# init the device
# toggle the pins you want to write to to output mode, this uses the config register for the pins.
# write to the output register for the pins. Each write will update the pins and update the device automatically
     
# use this to interact with I2C devices
