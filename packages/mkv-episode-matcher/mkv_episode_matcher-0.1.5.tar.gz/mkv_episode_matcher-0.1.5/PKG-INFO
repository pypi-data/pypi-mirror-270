# MKV Episode Matcher
 
The MKV Episode Matcher is a tool for identifying TV series episodes from MKV files and renaming the files accordingly. 

## Quick start

To use the MKV Episode Matcher, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Jsakkos/mkv-episode-matcher`
1. Obtain an API key from TMDb (https://developers.themoviedb.org/authentication/getting-a-apikey).
2. (Optional) - Obtain an API key from Opensubtitles.com by creating an API consumer (https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/consumers)
3. Provide a filepath to your show directory. This is the main directory that contains all of the episodes for a specific show.
The directory and subfolders must be arranged in the following structure:

- Show name
  - Season 1
  - Season 2
  - ...
  - Season n
2. Call `python __main__.py` with the TMDB_API_KEY and SHOW_DIR as arguments or in environment variables from your command line:

```
python __main__.py --api-key `your-api-key` --show-dir /path/to/show
```

## How it works

MKV Episode Matcher extracts the subtitle text from each MKV file, then crossreferences the text against .srt subtitle files that are either user-provided or downloaded from Opensubtitles.com
