<h5>Ways 2</h5> deb package 

*Download the latest release at the bottom that matches your computer's CPU architecture*  
*Cannot be installed on Termux!* if [proot-distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro) *environment is possible*  

It is a deb package that uses the compiled Python source.  


Please Make the X.X.X_\*\*\*\*\* part the same as the downloaded filename  
or specify it with a wildcard like uhelp*.deb  

```sh
apt install ./uhelp_X.X.X_*****.deb
```

  

<details>

<summary>*Do not install the PIP version and the DEB version together.*</summary>

##### conflict

Both are a method of starting the program by creating a symbolic link with the same name(uh) in usr/bin.  

So it is possible that one will not start.

## Usage

If you install with pip, you can call it with `uh`,  
and if you install deb with apt, you can call it with `uh` or `uhelp`.

show your command reference example below in case `ls`  

```sh
uh ls
```  
```sh
uhelp ls
```
