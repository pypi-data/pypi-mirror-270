<h2>ðŸ¤©information and TODO</h2>

### information

I just made it with a smartphone, so it works properly and I haven't been able to test it on PC.  
GitHub Action's my workflow intends to build a deb package of x64, a CPU architecture that I don't have  
I've never been able to test it, so if it doesn't work, I'd appreciate it if you could report it to the issue.  
Whether or not I can solve the problem with my programming skills is another matter.



### TODO&IDEA list

Make the prompt screens that appear in various places a little easier to see  


A function that suggests a list close to what you have entered? hmm
```sh
uhelp -list a
```

A function that creates an extra table and can pool .bashrc, settings, etc. and can be used with pipes
