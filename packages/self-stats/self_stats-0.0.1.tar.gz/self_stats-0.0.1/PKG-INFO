# TODO

- Make a blank data folder to submit to github for user access
  - The package version does not need this
- Change package name to something different
  - Better to change the repo name and keep the package the same
- Add plot titles
- Label axis better
- Add modules to the init files
- Document directory names
- Make module docstrings
- Leave some more comments throughout the script
- Add logic to retain asset images in installed package
  - Add assets to package directory and explicitly call for them with a MANIFEST.in file
  - setup.py should include "package_data" element
