  -n OUTPUT_NAME, --output-name OUTPUT_NAME
                        Base name for the output HTML files.
  -i IMAGES_SUBDIR, --images-subdir IMAGES_SUBDIR
                        Subdirectory for images. Expected to be in the
                        directory containing the Markdown file. Contents are
                        copied to a subdirectory by the same name in the

                        specified, a default style is embedded in the HTML
                        output. If a CSS file is specified, the default style
                        is not included.If the specified CSS file does not
