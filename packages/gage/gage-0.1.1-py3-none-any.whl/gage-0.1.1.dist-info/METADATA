### Setting up a Local Development Environment

1. Fork the source code repository at https://github.com/gageml/gage

2. Create a project-specific virtual environment. **Use Python 3.10 or
   later.**

   ``` shell
   cd gage
   virtualenv --python python3.10 .venv  # Any version >= 3.10 is okay
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment and use `pip` to install the project
   as "editable".

   ``` shell
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Works on most POSIX shells - change as needed
   pip install -e '.[dev]'    # Installs gage and its dev requirements
   ```

4. Run tests using [Groktest](https://github.com/gar1t/groktest)
   (optional).

   ``` shell
   groktest .
   ```
