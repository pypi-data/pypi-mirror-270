    A Standard Input/Output Test

    Traditionally, a stdio test would have no arguments passed to the command, it would have an input file, and a goal file.
    Output is piped to some output file that is not committed to version control.

    This new stdio test is very similar, but it can also do what a traditional arg test could do:
    take no input, and have custom arguments passed to the command.
    If you don't want anything directed into the command's stdin, then just assign None to input_file.
    If you want custom arguments passed to the command, give those custom arguments to the command argument (you may have to do that manually).
