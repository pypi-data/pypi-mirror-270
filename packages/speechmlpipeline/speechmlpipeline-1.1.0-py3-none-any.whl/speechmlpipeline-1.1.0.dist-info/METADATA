## SpeechMLPipeline #
[**SpeechMLPipeline**](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/SpeechMLPipeline) is a Python package for users to run the complete speech machine learning pipeline via one simple function
to get transcriptions with speaker labels from input audio files. SpeechMLPipeline applys and implements the most widely used and the innovative machine learning
models at each step of the pipeline:
 * **Audio-to-Text Transcription**: [OpenAI Whisper with timestamp adjustment](https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped)
 * **Speaker Change Detection**: [PyAnnotate](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1), [Audio-based Spectral Clustering Model](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection), [Text-based Llama2-70b Speaker Change Detection Model](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection), [Rule-based NLP Speaker Change Detection Model](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection), [Ensemble Audio-and-text-based Speaker Change Detection Model](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection)
 * **Speaker Identification**: [Speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)

**Audio-to-text Transcription**
* The [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped) is selected for the audio-to-text transcription as it is the most accurate model available for English transcription. The OpenAI Whisper with timestamp adjustment is used to reduce the
misalignment between the timestamps and the transcription texts by identifying the silence parts and predicting timestamps at the word level.

**Speaker Change Detection**
* The [PyAnnotate models](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) is by far one of the most popular models for speaker diarization. It detects speaker change by applying clustering methods based on audio features. The speaker change detection results are directly inferred from speaker diarization results.

* The [Audio-based Spectral Clustering Model](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection) is developed by extracting audio features from Librosa and applying spectral clustering to audio features. This model is one of the most common speaker change detection models used in academic research.

* The [Text-based Llama2-70b Speaker Change Detection Model](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection) is an innovative speaker change detection model based on LLMs. It is developed by asking Llama2 if the speaker changes across two consecutive text segments by understanding the interrelationships between these two texts via their semantic meaning. 

* The [Rule-based NLP Speaker Change Detection Model](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection) is applied to detect speaker change by analyzing text using well-defined rules developed by human comprehension. 

* The [Ensemble Audio-and-text-based Speaker Change Detection Models](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/AudioAndTextBasedSpeakerChangeDetection) is built by ensembling audio-based or text-based speaker change detection models. The voting methods are used to aggregate the predictions of the speaker change detection models above except for Rule-based NLP model.
The aggregated predictions are then corrected by Rule-based NLP model. It has two models, the Majority Model based on the majority voting and the Unanimity Model based on the unanimity voting.


**Speaker Identification**
* The [Speechbrain models](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) are used to perform the speaker identification by comparing the similarities between the vector embeddings of each input audio segment and labelled speakers audio segments.

## Usage
The complete pipeline could be run by using **run_speech_ml_pipeline** function which could be directly imported as 
```Python
from speechmlpipeline import run_speech_ml_pipeline
```

The **run_speech_ml_pipeline** function takes four classes instances corresponding to each step in the Speech Machine Learning Pipeline as the inputs:

* **transcription**:
TranscriptionInputs Class to specify inputs to run OpenAI Whisper for Audio-to-Text Transcription with Timestamps Adjustment
* **speakerchangedetection**:
SpeakerChangeDetectionInputs Class to specify inputs to run various models including PyAnnote Model, Spectral Clustering, Llama2, and NLP Rule-Based Analysis for Speaker Change Detection
* **ensembledetection**:
EnsembleDetectionInputs Class to specify inputs to build an Ensemble Model of Speaker Change Detection by considering both audio and textual features
* **speakeridentification**:
SpeakerIdentificationInputs Class to specify inputs to run Speechbrain Verification Model for Speaker Identification

To run the complete pipeline, the function could be called as
```Python
run_speech_ml_pipeline(transcription = TranscriptionInputs(...),
                       speakerchangedetection=SpeakerChangeDetectionInputs(...), ensembledetection=EnsembleDetectionInputs(...),
                       speakeridentification=SpeakerIdentificationInputs(...))
```

To run any particular steps, please simply just use the inputs corresponding to the particular steps.

For instance, to run all steps of the pipeline with the existing transcriptions:
```Python
run_speech_ml_pipeline(speakerchangedetection=SpeakerChangeDetectionInputs(...), ensembledetection=EnsembleDetectionInputs(...),
                       speakeridentification=SpeakerIdentificationInputs(...))
```

For instance, to run speaker change detection with the existing transcriptions:
```Python
run_speech_ml_pipeline(speakerchangedetection=SpeakerChangeDetectionInputs(...), ensembledetection=EnsembleDetectionInputs(...))
```

For instance, to run speaker identification with the existing transcriptions and speaker change detection results:
```Python
run_speech_ml_pipeline(speakeridentification=SpeakerIdentificationInputs(...))
```

[VoxConverse Dataset v0.3](https://github.com/joonson/voxconverse?tab=readme-ov-file)

VoxConverse is an only audio-visual diarization dataset consisting of over 50 hours of multispeaker clips of human speech, extracted from YouTube videos, usually in a political debate or news segment context to ensure multi-speaker dialogue.
The audio files in the dataset have lots of variations of the proportion of speaker changes, which indicates the effectiveness of the dataset as the evaluation dataset to evaluate the models robustness.

Average Coverage, Purity, Precision, and Recall

|           | PyAnnote | Llama2 | Unanimity | Majority | 
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Coverage  | 86%      | 45%    | 59%       | 84%      | 
| Purity    | 83%      | 89%    | 87%       | 70%      | 
| Precision | 23%      | 14%    | 24%       | 32%      | 
| Recall    | 19%      | 32%    | 41%       | 19%      | 


[AMI Headset Mix](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/overview.shtml)

The AMI Meeting Corpus is a multi-modal data set consisting of 100 hours of meeting recordings. Around two-thirds of the data has been elicited using a scenario in which the participants play different roles in a design team, taking a design project from kick-off to completion over the course of a day. The rest consists of naturally occurring meetings in a range of domains.
Different from VoxConverse Dataset, AMI dataset is not that diverse as it only consists of meeting recordings. The median and average proportion of speaker change is both around 78%, and the minimal proportion is above 59%. Thus, the evaluation analysis based on AMI is more applicable to measure the models performance under regular conversational setting.

Average Coverage, Purity, Precision, and Recall

|           | PyAnnote | Llama2 | Unanimity | Majority | 
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Coverage  | 89%      | 75%    | 80%       | 92%      | 
| Purity    | 60%      | 65%    | 64%       | 46%      | 
| Precision | 44%      | 32%    | 40%       | 46%      | 
| Recall    | 18%      | 18%    | 25%       | 11%      |
