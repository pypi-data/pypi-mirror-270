shortcode: "savings_mc_tool"
name: "Saving Monte Carlo Tool"
purpose: >
  Computes the contributions to underlying assets for each year taking into account the savings each year and parameters. These parameters (interest rate and market returns) will be loaded from files and will be provided to run the simulation.
