"""
Examine summation errors and duplicate errors in filings.

The purpose of this view is to reduce the set of validation messages to
the ones most relevant from an accounting reliability perspective.

Ordered starting from the most severe error based on ``errorPercent``.
The last rows are typically rounding errors.

A summation error arises in the filing when the reported data points and
reported calculation tree (calculation linkbase) do not match. A
duplicate errors arises when there is one data point which is reported
twice (e.g. net income on income statement and cash flow statement) but
with different values.

The view only takes into account one language version of a single
accounting disclosure. It is assumed that all language versions contain
the same data but only language of the report differs. It is customary
that entities reporting in ESEF format report in the language of their
domicile and English. Selected language is NULL or the first occurrence
in an alphabetically ordered list. It is assumed that filings are part
of the same enclosure when they have the same entity ``api_id`` and
``reporting_date``.

Duplicate errors are reported twice in the data but these duplicates are
reported only once in the view. A serious caveat for duplicates is that
the source data does not report the line item element name. Duplicates
are matched solely based on their numeric values in the same filing and
thus there could be two different line items which have been both
reported twice and with the exact same numeric values. This is also true
with regards to reporting periods for the same line item (in other
words, for a data point).

Columns
-------
entity_name : TEXT or NULL
    Name of the entity from column ``Entity.name``.
reporting_date : TEXT or NULL
    Reporting date of the enclosure from column
    ``Filing.reporting_date``.
problem : {'calc', 'duplicate'}
    Type of matched validation message(s), 'calc' for summation errors
    and 'duplicate' for duplicate errors.
reportedK : REAL or NULL
    Column ``ValidationMessage.calc_reported_sum`` for problem='calc' or
    ``ValidationMessage.duplicate_lesser`` for problem='duplicate' in
    thousands.
computedOrDuplicateK : REAL or NULL
    Column ``ValidationMessage.calc_computed_sum`` for problem='calc' or
    ``ValidationMessage.duplicate_greater`` for problem='duplicate' in
    thousands.
reportedErrorK : REAL or NULL
    Deviation from properly calculated value or the value of the other
    duplicate in thousands.
errorPercent : REAL or NULL
    Percentage of error ``reportedErrorK`` based on reported value or
    lesser duplicate.
calc_line_item : TEXT or NULL
    Line item element name from ``ValidationMessage.calc_line_item`` for
    problem='calc'.
calc_short_role : TEXT or NULL
    Short linkrole name (name of financial statement) from
    ``ValidationMessage.calc_short_role`` for problem='calc'.

    Context ID of XBRL fact from ``ValidationMessage.calc_context_id``
    for problem='calc'.
language : TEXT or NULL
    Language of the filing from ``Filing.language``.
