Contributing
============

Any form of contribution is welcome!

Workflow
--------

First, get the source code:

.. prompt:: bash

   git clone https://git.sysrq.in/find-work

Make some changes and run the tests and the linters:

.. prompt:: bash

   tox run

Commit the changes. Your commit message should conform to the following
standard::

    file/changed: concice and complete statement of the purpose

    This is the body of the commit message.  The line above is the
    summary.  The summary should be no more than 72 chars long.  The
    body can be more freely formatted, but make it look nice.  Make
    sure to reference any bug reports and other contributors.  Make
    sure the correct authorship appears.

Use `git rebase`_ if needed to make commit history look good.

.. _git rebase: https://git-rebase.io/

Finally, send a patch to the developer using `git send-email`_:

.. prompt:: bash

   git send-email --to=cyber@sysrq.in origin/master

.. _git send-email: https://git-send-email.io/

.. note::
   If you prefer GitHub-style workflow, use the `mirror repo`_ to send pull
   requests.

.. _mirror repo: https://github.com/cybertailor/find-work

Adding a new module
-------------------

1. Create a new Python file in the :file:`find_work/cli` directory.
2. Implement all logic here.
3. Register commands in the :file:`find_work/__main__.py` file.
4. Update the manpage and release notes.

Feel free to copy/paste from existing sources, I do the same.

Naming conventions
------------------

:py:class:`click.Group` name must be the same as the Python module that
implements its commands.

:py:class:`click.Command` wrapped function's name should be the same as its
primary name. If that's not possible, use one of aliases instead.

Code style
----------

Whatever the almighty linters say, should be at least `PEP 8`_.
