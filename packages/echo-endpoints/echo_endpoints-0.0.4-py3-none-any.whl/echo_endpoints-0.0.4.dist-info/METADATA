EchoEndpoints                                        

EchoEndpoints is designed to simplify the process of making HTTP requests,
handling responses, and interacting with APIs.

It offers a suite of functions that cover various aspects of web requests,
including sending requests with different HTTP methods,
managing request headers and data, handling exceptions,
and parsing and printing responses in a readable format.

The script also includes functionality for loading JSON data from files,
which can be particularly useful for setting up request payloads,
or storing configuration data. Additionally, it employs ANSI color codes
to enhance the readability of output, making it easier to identify important
information at a glance.

This script is intended as a helpful tool for developers working with web APIs,
providing a robust foundation for custom integration and testing needs.
