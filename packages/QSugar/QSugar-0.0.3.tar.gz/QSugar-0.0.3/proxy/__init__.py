"""
The framework mainly uses decorator syntax to implement dynamic proxies.

And the submodules are described below:
    - `count`
        * proxy setter methods in the style of the Fluent api
        * implement the `self` property to get the control handle proxy
        * simplify the naming and calling of some attributes

    - `bind`
        * proxy setter methods to accommodate reactive programming

    - `dsl`
        * implement the child and children properties to meet the most basic nested DSL requirements

More modules are coming...
Any good ideas? Welcome to contact me!
