    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The purpose of of this program is to compare <b>BOMs</b> (Bills of Materials)
      derived from a <b>CAD</b> program (like SolidWorks) and compare them to BOMs
      from an <b>ERP</b> database program (like that of SyteLine).  The CAD and
      ERP programs must be able to export to Excel files.  BOMs are gathered
      for comparison from these Excel files.</p>

    <h2 id="basics">Basics you need to know</h2>
    <p>The file names for BOMs that come from the CAD program should be
      the part no. of the BOM followed by _sw.xlsx. That is, names like
      0300-2010-005_sw.xlsx,&nbsp; 093352_sw.xlsx,&nbsp; and 35K2445_sw.xlsx&nbsp; are all
      legitimate file names.&nbsp; Similarly the names of the files from the ERP database should end
      with _sl.xlsx. Thus the names will look like 0300-2010-005_sl.xlsx,&nbsp;
      093352_sl.xlsx,&nbsp; and 35K2445_sl.xlsx. The program will match the
      0300-2010-005_sw.xlsx file to the 0300-2010-005_sl.xlsx file, and so forth.</p>

    <p>A BOM from an ERP database can be a mulilevel BOM. For the BOM
      to be recognized as a multilevel BOM, a column named "Level" must exist.
      The Level column gives the relative level of subassemblies
      within a main assembly. The Level column starts out with "0" for the top
      level assembly, "1" for parts/subassemblies under the main assembly, "2" for
      a parts/subassembly under a Level "1" subassembly, and so forth.</p>

    <p>A BOM from a CAD program can also be multilevel.  For a CAD BOM to be
      recognized as multilevel BOM, it must have a column named "ITEM NO.".
      The numbers in that column should look something like this:
      1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3, 4, etc..</p>

    <p><b>Tip #1:</b> If two or more underscore characters exist within a file name,
      like 094433_testBOM_sw.xlsx, the characters between the first and last underscore
      characters will be ignored.  In this case testBOM.</p>

    <p><b>Tip #2:</b> If the ERP BOM is a multilevel BOM (i.e. has a column
      named "Level"), then any characters proceeding the "_sl.xlsx" characters
      will be ignored. Instead the part number is obtained from within the
      Excel file where the part no. for Level 0 is shown.</p>


    <h2 id="run">How to run bomcheck</h2>
    <p>To run the program from the command line, run like this (assuming you
      did the <i>pip install bomcheck</i> method do install bomcheck.py to
      your system):</p>

      <ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><code>C:\> bomcheck</code></li></ul>

    <p>(If you'd rather have a graphical user interface (GUI), use bomcheckgui
      instead.) When the above command is run, help info will be shown about required
      command line arguments.</p>

    <p> If you obtain the file named bomcheck.py, which is the source code for
      bomcheck, you can run bomcheck from within a <a href="https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-interective-shell">python shell</a>.
      Within bomcheck.py there is a function named bomcheck().  Excecute this
      function to run bomcheck from within the shell.  Execute it like this:</p>


      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
          <li><code>>>> import bomcheck as bc</code></li>
          <li><code>>>> bc.bomcheck(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)</code></li>
      </ul>

    <p>(Note: requirements for running from a shell are pandas>=1.2,
       toml>=0.10, openpyxl>=3.0, and python>=3.8) To see information
       about arguments used in bomcheck(), do:
    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li><code>>>> help(bc.bomcheck)</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that if an error occurs when checking your BOMs, or if bomcheck is
      confused about some data that was entered, a message will be shown that
      describes the problem. Otherwise look for something you may have done
      wrong like failing to attach the _sl.xlsx or _sw.xlsx characters to the
      file name.
    </p>

    <h2 id="interpreting">Interpreting results</h2>

    <p>The columns I, Q, D, and U show Xs if <b>I</b>tem, <b>Q</b>uantity, <b>D</b>escription, or
      <b>U</b>nit of measure don't match between the SolidWorks BOM and the ERP BOM.
      Q_sw and Q_sl are quanties in CAD and ERP. Desription_sw and
      Description_sl are descriptions in CAD and ERP. U_sw and U_sl are
      U/Ms (units of measure) in CAD and ERP. Shown above, the 1309031 part is in the ERP but
      not in CAD.  Thus the blank space in CAD's pn column.
      Likewise, 130039 is in CAD but not in ERP</p>


    <h2 id="UofM">Units of Measure</h2>
    <p>If a unit of measure (U/M) is not given for a value in the LENGTH column
      of a SolidWorks' BOM, then the U/M is assumed to be Inches (unless changed
      in the bomcheck.cfg file). However the U/M can be explicity specified,
      e.g. <b>336.7mm</b>. The program will recognize the following abreviations
      for U/Ms, and only these:</p>

    <p>in, inch, ”, ft, ', feet, foot, yrd, yd, yard, mm, millimeter, cm,
      centimeter, m, meter, mtr, sqin, sqi, sqft, sqf, sqyd, sqy, sqmm, sqcm,
      sqm, pint, pt, qt, quart, gal, g, gallon, ltr, l, liter.</p>

    <p>Units of measure are not case sensitive.  So, for example, you can
      use <i>sqin</i> or  <i>SQIN</i>.  Also, sq in is not the same as sqin, so
      sq in will not be recognized.

    <p>When the program is run, values will be converted to the U/M shown in the
      ERP database program. For example, 336.7mm will be converted to 1.10 ft,
      and 8 pints will be converted to 1.00 gal. Other names that can be
      substituted for the column name LENGTH in a SolidWorks BOM are: SIZE,
      Length, L, SIZE, AMT, AMOUNT, and MEAS.  (Column names are case
      sensitive.)</p>

    <p>(FYI: bomcheck text files are Tab delimited)</p>


    <h2 id="ERPvsERP">ERP BOM vs ERP BOM howto</h2>
    <p>The bomcheck program has been designed specifically to compare a CAD BOMs
       to an ERP BOMs.  However with a bit of finagaling, it can be used to
       compare an ERP BOM to an ERP BOM.  Here's how:</p>

       <ol>
           <li>Extract the two BOMs you wish to compare and save them to
               Excel files.  Use <u>multilevel</u> BOMs.  For example, let's imagine
               you saved them to 101304_sl.xlsx and 089432_sl.xlsx</li>
           <li>Rename the first file to 101304_sw.xlsx (or to 089432_sw.xlsx
               if you wish.  I doesn't matter)</li>
           <li>Open in Excel the 101304_sw.xlsx file and go to the line that
               shows level 0:
                <table class="table table-striped table-sm">
                  <thead>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="col">Level</th>
                      <th scope="col">Item</th>
                      <th scope="col">Description</th>
                      <th scope="col">Qty Per</th>
                      <th scope="col">U/M</th </tr>
                  </thead>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td>0</td>
                      <td>101304</td>
                      <td>DZS 300V TRIPLEX</td>
                      <td>1.000</td>
                      <td>EA</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                Change the Item there from 101304 to 089432.
           </li>
         <li>Save the Excel file and run the bomcheck program and compare
             the 101304_sw.xlsx (or 098432_sw.xlsx) and the 089432_sl.xlsx files.
             (101304_sw.xlsx works because for multilevel ERP BOMs the 101304
             portion of the filename is ignored and bomcheck instead gets the
             Item no. from that shown at level 0.)
         </li>
         <li>When you look at your BOM check results, you won't see number
             101304 listed anywhere.  Instead look for the number 089432.
             You'll see the comparison results there. (Subassembly BOMs will,
             of course, be present also.)  The parts, quantities, etc. for
             the 101304 system will be shown in the "sw" columns where numbers
             from a CAD file are normally shown.
         </li>
      </ol>

     <p>If you have BOMs that are NOT multilevel, then rename the 101304_sw.xlsx
       file to 089432_sw.xlsx, and then compare it to the 089422_sl.xlsx file.</p>


     <h2 id="droplist">drop list & exceptions list</h2>
     <p>Perhaps you have parts that show in the CAD BOM, and they are not to
        be shown in the ERP BOM.  For example hardware bolts and nuts that are
        common stock items.  These will show up as errors when bomcheck is run.
        However you can exclude these CAD items from the check.  To do this enter
        these items in what is called a drop list.  The list will look something
        like this:</p>

     <p>["3*-025", "3182-*"]</p>

     <p>Add as many items to the list as you like.  If there are exceptions
       to this that you would like to account for, then create an exceptions
       list.  Here is an example of an exceptions list:</p>

     <p>["3042-*-025", "3182-0000-001"]</p>

     <p>The drop and exceptions lists can be activated in three different ways:</p>

     <ol type="1">
        <li>Enter your drop and exceptions lists in a
        <a href="#bomcheckcfg">bomcheck.cfg</a> file.  Then when you run bomcheck
        from the command line invoke the <i>-d</i>
        switch.  (Tip: run <i>bomcheck --help</i> on the command line to see a list
        of options.)
        </li>

        <li>When running bomcheck from the command line, enter your
        drop and excecptions list directly as an option on the command line.
        E.g. <i>bomcheck --drop ["3*-025"] --exceptions ["3042-*-025"] filename</i>.
        (The <i>-d</i> switch will automatically be invoked; --drop
        arguments will supersede values values from a bomcheck.cfg file.)</li>

        <li>When running bomcheck via the bomcheckgui program (bomcheckgui
        is a wrapper for the bomcheck program) go to bomcheckgui's <i>settings</i>
        and enter your drop and exceptions lists there.  Click the "Activate drop list"
        check box to activate these lists when bomcheck is run.  (When running
        this way the drop and exceptions lists in <i>settings</i> supersede those lists in
        the bomcheck.cfg file.)</li>
     </ol>


    <h2 id="bomcheckcfg">bomcheck.cfg</h2>
    <p>Download the file named bomcheck.cfg
      <a href="https://github.com/kcarlton55/bomcheck/blob/master/docs/" download>(download link)</a>
      that contains settings that you can change in order to alter how the
      bomcheck program behaves.  For example, you can change units of measure,
      change what column headings that bomcheck recognizes, redirect html links
      that are used by bomcheckgui's help menu, etc..</p>

      <p>Open bomcheck.cfg with a text editor program
      such as Microsoft's Wordpad.exe. (Warning: different text editors can
