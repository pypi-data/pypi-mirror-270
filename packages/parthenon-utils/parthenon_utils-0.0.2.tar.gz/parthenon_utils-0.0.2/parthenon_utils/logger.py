        Initializes and configures the logger with a custom format and

        This method creates a new logging.Logger instance or retrieves an 
        existing one based on the provided log filename. It sets the logging 
        level to the value specified during the class initialization and
        configures the logger to not propagate messages to higher level loggers. 
        Additionally, it defines a custom log format that includes timestamps,
        logging levels, logger name, module name, function name, thread ID, line
        number, and the log message itself.

        The custom format and datetime format are designed to provide a detailed
        and easily readable log output, facilitating debugging and monitoring of
        application behavior.

        Returns:
        --------
        logging.Logger
            The configured logger instance with the specified level, custom 
            format, and disabled propagation.

        Example Usage:
        --------------
        # Assuming the Logger class has been instantiated with the necessary
        parameters:
        >>> logger_instance = myLogger.log
        # logger_instance is now ready to be used for logging messages 
        # throughout the application, with messages formatted and handled
        # according to the configuration defined in this method.

        Note:
        -----
        The logger's name is set to the filename derived from the code runtime 
        and filename parameters provided during Logger class initialization. 
        This name uniqueness helps in identifying the source of log messages, 
        especially when multiple instances of the Logger class are used within
        the same application.

        Configures and adds file and stream handlers to the specified logger.

        This method sets up two primary handlers for the logger: a file handler,
        which writes log messages to a file, and a stream handler, which directs
        log messages to stderr. Both handlers are configured to use the 
        specified logging format.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        logger : logging.Logger
            The logger instance to which the file and stream handlers will be 
            added. This logger should already be initialized and have a name
            assigned.

        log_format : logging.Formatter
            The formatting object that defines the format of log messages. This
            format will be applied to both file and stream handlers to ensure 
            consistency in log output.

        Raises:
        ------
        Exception:
            Catches and logs any exception that occurs during the setup of log
            handlers. This is to ensure that any failure in initializing 
            handlers, such as issues with file access permissions or problems 
            creating the file handler, does not cause the application to crash.
            Instead, an error message will be logged using the logger itself,
            indicating the failure to initialize log handlers.

        Notes:
        -----
        - The file handler is configured to append to the log file specified by 
        self.log_filepath, ensuring that logs are preserved across different 
        executions of the code.
        - The stream handler directs log messages to stderr, allowing for 
        real-time monitoring of log messages when running the code in 
        environments that display stderr output.

        Example Usage:
        -------------
        The method is intended to be called within the Logger class during the 
        initialization process and is not designed to be invoked directly by 
        external code. Here is how it is used internally:

            self._setup_log_handlers(logger=self.log, log_format=my_log_format)

        This example assumes that self.log is a pre-initialized logging.Logger 
        instance and my_log_format is a configured logging.Formatter instance.

        Parameters:

        enabled : bool
            If True, logging is enabled at the logger's current level. If False,
            logging is effectively silenced by setting the logger's level to
            a level above CRITICAL.

            raised to prevent incorrect usage.

        Notes:
        -----
        - Silencing the logger does not remove handlers but sets their level to
          CRITICAL + 1, which is effectively higher than any standard logging 
          level, thus preventing any logs from being processed.
