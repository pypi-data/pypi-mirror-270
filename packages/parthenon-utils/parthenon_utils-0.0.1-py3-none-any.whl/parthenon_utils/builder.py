    A utility class that provides various methods to handle file and directory
    operations. It supports creating directories, deleting files or directories,
    renaming files, and searching for files based on different criteria such as
    name, size, or extension. It can also perform more complex tasks like
    comparing directories or copying/moving entire directories.
    
    Attributes:
        - base_path (Optional[Path]): 
            The base path for all file operations. If specified, all relative
            paths in methods will be appended to this base path. This is helpful
            to centralize file operations within a specific directory.
        - ctrl_log (Logger):
            The logging object used to log messages about file operations. By 
            default, it uses a 'NoLogger' which does not perform any logging
            unless replaced with a functional Logger.

        Renames files within a specified directory or directories, allowing for

        Parameters
        ----------
        this_path : Path
            A single Path object or a list of Path objects representing the
            directory or directories containing files to be renamed. If a list
            is provided, each Path in the list should point to valid directory.

        prefix : Optional[str], optional
            A string to be added as a prefix to each file's name. If None, no
            prefix is added. Default is None.

        name : Optional[str], optional
            A new name to replace the original file name (excluding the
            extension). If None, the original file name (stem) is retained.
            This allows for complete renaming of the file while preserving its
            extension. Default is None.

        suffix : Optional[str], optional
            A string to be added as a suffix to each file's name, appearing
            before the file's extension. If None, no suffix is added. Default is
            None.

        Returns
        -------
        List[Path]
            A list of Path objects representing the renamed files. Each Path in
            the list points to the new location and name of the renamed file.

        Notes
        -----
        - The `@ensure_path` decorator ensures that `this_path` is converted to
        a Path object if it is not already one, facilitating consistent handling
        of file paths.

        - The `@exception_handler` decorator wraps the method to handle common
        file system errors gracefully, such as permission errors or files not
        found, providing a more user-friendly error message.

        - This method can be particularly useful for batch processing of files,
        such as renaming a large number of files to conform to a specific naming
        convention or structure.
