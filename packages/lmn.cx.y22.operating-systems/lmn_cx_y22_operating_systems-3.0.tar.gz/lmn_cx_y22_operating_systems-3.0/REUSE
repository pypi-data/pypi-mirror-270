
The copyright and licensing for the contents of this project are
tracked using the REUSE Specification. For more information on this
standard, see <https://reuse.software/spec/>.

For most files, this means we keep track of copyright and licensing
using SPDX headers. For example, the SPDX headers for this REUSE
file are:

    SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Alex Lemna
    SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0

For all other significant files in this project, the SPDX headers will
be in the first lines of the file. Any exceptions to this rule will
have their copyright and licensing information stored in one of the
alternate methods discussed at <https://reuse.software/spec/>, i.e.,

  - comment headers in an adjacent file of the same name plus the 
    `.license` extension (e.g., `dog.png` and `dog.png.license`), 
    or

  - a DEP5 file located at `.reuse/dep5` relative to the root
    directory of this project.

Some files may contain sections which are licensed differently - for 
instance, if I have directly copied code from other open source 
projects or from blogs, StackOverflow posts, et cetera. In these
cases, the section will be clearly associated with additional SPDX
tags to indicate that section's copyrights and licensing.
