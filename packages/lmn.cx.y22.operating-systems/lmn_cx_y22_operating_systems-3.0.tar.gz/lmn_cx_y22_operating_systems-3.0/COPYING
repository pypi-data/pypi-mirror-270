# COPYING

The software in this project is available under your choice of
any of the following licenses:

  - The BSD Zero Clause License (or `0BSD`)
  - The MIT License (or `MIT`)
  - The Apache License 2.0 (or `Apache-2.0`)

It is available under multiple licenses because I couldn't decide
which I liked best.

If you're copying code from this project into your project, the
BSD Zero Clause License is probably the license you want. No
attribution necessary.

If you're not familiar with the BSD Zero Clause License and you
don't want to have to read up or do research on some license you've
never heard of just to copy/edit my code, the MIT License is
probably for you. You've probably copied/edited code from other
projects using the MIT License, so you know the rules. Attribution
is necessary. 

If you like reading software licenses, or if you have investors to
protect, or if you simply might find yourself in a situation where
a lawyer is asking you questions about your software licenses, the 
Apache License 2.0 is probaby the license for you.

You can view the full text of any of these licenses in the LICENSES
directory. The full text of the BSD Zero Clause License is also
present in this repository's root directory since GitHub (as of
early 2024) does not auto-discover licenses outside of the root
directory, and I wanted to at least make it clear what this 
software's most permissive license was.

You can find more information on our use of SPDX headers to provide
machine-readable information for each file in this project in
the REUSE file.
