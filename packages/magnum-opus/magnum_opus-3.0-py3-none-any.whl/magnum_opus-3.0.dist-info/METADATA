# About

A python based task processing engine backend.

# Usage

The intent of this project is to use it as a library to process tasks that conform to a certain style.

A typical stack will include the following components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Application] -- parses configuration using --> B[Parsing Library]
    A -- execute parsed configuration using --> C[magnum-opus]
```

The client application has to provide the following implementations:

| Base Class         | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LoggerWrapper`    | ( optional ) Used for logging. If not implemented, log messages from `magnum-opus` will be printed to STDOUT                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `StatePersistance` | ( optional ) Used to persist state during the various stages of task execution. Can also be used by `TaskProcessor` implementation to retrieve previous execution state of any individual task. If not implemented by the client, no persistance functionality will be provided/available. |
| `TaskProcessor`    | ( required ) This is the class that implements the logic of processing a given task. No out-of-the-bos task processors exist, so the client must supply it's own.                                                                                                                          |

The client then creates an instance of `Tasks` and adds all `TaskProcessor` implementations before adding `Task` objects. Finally, the processing is performed by calling the `process_context()` method of the `Tasks` instance.

The [opus-instrumenta](https://github.com/nicc777/opus-instrumenta) project provides some "standard" `TaskProcessor` implementations for common types of tasks.

## Hello World Example

Here is a really quick ["hello world" example](./examples/hello_world.py) that will implement a `TaskProcessor` that creates a file with the text "Hello World!" in it:

```sh
python3 examples/hello_world.py
```

The example can also be observed as a unit test by running the test file [tests/test_hello_world.py](tests/test_hello_world.py)

# Development Quick Start

Preparing your local system for development:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv

. venv/bin/activate

pip3 install coverage build twine
```
