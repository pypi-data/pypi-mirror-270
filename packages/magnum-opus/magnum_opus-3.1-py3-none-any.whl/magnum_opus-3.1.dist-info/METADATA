# About

A python based task processing workflow backend.

# Usage

The intent of this project is to use it as a library to process tasks that conform to a certain style.

A typical stack will include the following components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Application] -- parses configuration using --> B[Parsing Library]
    A -- execute parsed configuration using --> C[magnum-opus]
```

Detailed documentation is provided in the source code.

## Hello World Example

Here is a really quick ["hello world" example](./examples/hello_world.py) that will implement a `TaskProcessor` that creates a file with the text "Hello World!" in it:

```sh
python3 examples/hello_world.py
```

The example can also be observed as a unit test by running the test file [tests/test_hello_world.py](tests/test_hello_world.py)

# Development Quick Start

Preparing your local system for development:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv

. venv/bin/activate

pip3 install coverage build twine
```
