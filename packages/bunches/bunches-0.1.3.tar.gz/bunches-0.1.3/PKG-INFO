## What is bunches?

[TODO: Brief summary of the project]

## Why use bunches?

## Mappings

* `Dictionary`: drop-in replacement for a python dict with an `add` method for a default mechanism of adding data, a `delete` method for a default mechanism of deleting data, and a `subset` method for returning a subset of the key/value pairs in a new `Dictionary`.
* `Catalog`: wildcard-accepting dict which is intended for storing different options and strategies. It also returns lists of matches if a list of keys is provided.
* `Library`: a dictionary that automatically supplies key names for stored items. The 'overwrite' argument determines if a unique key should always be created or whether entries may be overwritten.

### Sequences

* `Listing`: drop-in replacement for a python list with an `add` method for a default mechanism of adding data, a `delete` method for a default mechanism of deleting data, and a `subset` method for returning a subset of the key/value pairs in a new `Listing`.
* `DictList`: iterable with both dict and list interfaces. Stored items must be hashable or have a `name` attribute.

## Similar Projects

[TODO: If they exist, it is always nice to acknowledge other similar efforts]

## Acknowledgments

I'd also like to extend a special thanks to [pawamoy](https://github.com/pawamoy) whose excellent `pdm` and `mkdocs` extensions and utlities are incorporated into `snickerdoodle`. Some of the scripts, documentation, configuration files, and other CI code were all adapted from pawamoy's repositories.

I would also like to thank the University of Kansas School of Law for tolerating and supporting this law professor's coding efforts, an endeavor which is well outside the typical scholarly activities in the discipline.
