# SCARCCpy - Simulation of Combined Antibiotics in Cross-feeding Communities

SCARCC is a python package developed by the Harcombe Lab designed to identify synergistic interactions between antibiotics within our two-species cross-feeding microbial community. 

This package utilizes [COBRA](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy) to analyze the perturbation effects caused by antibiotics in the genome-scale metabolic network using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and [COMETS](https://github.com/segrelab/cometspy) simulations to incorporate multispecies growth simulation using Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (dFBA).
