Replace `<repo>` with the path to your local repository, the URL of a remote repository, or the owner/repo format for GitHub repositories.

- `-a`, `--author`: Specify the author's email or name to filter commits by
- `-o`, `--output`: Specify the path to save the genie's wisdom as a markdown file

### Examples 🌟

Summon the genie to unravel the riddles of a local repository:

```bash
riddlesolver /path/to/local/repo
```

Summon the genie to decipher the commits of a remote repository within a specific date range:

```bash
riddlesolver https://github.com/owner/repo -s 2023-01-01 -e 2023-01-31
```

Summon the genie to reveal the secrets of the last 2 weeks in silent mode:

```bash
riddlesolver owner/repo -w 2 --silent
```

Summon the genie to uncover the riddles of a specific branch:

```bash
riddlesolver /path/to/local/repo -b feature-branch
```

Summon the genie to expose the commits by a specific author:

```bash
riddlesolver owner/repo -a john@example.com
```

Summon the genie to capture its wisdom in a markdown file:

```bash
riddlesolver /path/to/local/repo -o summary.md
```

## Configuration 🔧

To customize the genie's behavior and grant it access to the OpenAI API, create a sacred scroll called `config.ini` in the genie's realm (`~/.riddlesolver/config.ini`).

```ini
[openai]
api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
model = gpt-3.5-turbo
base_url = https://api.openai.com/v1

[general]
verbose = False
batch_size = 50
```

- `api_key`: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key (the genie needs it to work its magic!)
- `model`: Specify the OpenAI model for the genie to use (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- `base_url`: Specify the base URL for the OpenAI API (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
- `verbose`: Set to `True` to enable verbose mode and witness the genie's behind-the-scenes magic
- `batch_size`: Specify the number of riddles the genie should process in each batch (default: `50`)

## Contributing 🤝

If you wish to contribute to the genie's power and make it even more extraordinary, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository. The genie appreciates all the help it can get!

## License 📜

RiddleSolver is released under the MIT License, granting you the power to use, modify, and distribute the genie as you see fit.

## Acknowledgements 🙏

The genie would like to express its gratitude to the mighty OpenAI for granting it the power of language understanding and generation. Without their API, the genie would be just another ordinary commit summarizer.

Now, prepare to be amazed as RiddleSolver unravels the mysteries of your Git commits and brings clarity to your development journey! 🎉✨
