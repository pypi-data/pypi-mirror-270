*SVInsight* is a python package for calculating an exploratory social vulnerability index. This package calculates SVI using two methods: (1) an iterative factor analysis method and (2) a rank method, both of which have been heavily utilized in scholarly research. This package automates the creation and comparisons of indices using U.S. American Community Survey 5-Year Data (ACS5) at the block group or tract level. Users can customize which social, demographic, and economic variables are included in their own custom indices.

This package is a tool to efficiently calculate an exploratory estimate of social vulnerability for a given region. Social vulnerability is an incredibly complex and constantly evolving concept, and researchers, practitioners, and users of this software should always consult relevant peer-reviewed literature and local experts to validate findings.

For user guides, examples, and a more indepth discussion of social vulnerability indices, refer to the [documentation](https://mdp0023.github.io/SVInsight/).
