- Methods for managing cards, decks, and templates
- Support for custom fields and attachments in cards
- Easy to integrate with Python applications

## Installation
Install the Mochi API Client using pip:

```sh

```

# Quick Start
Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
from mochi.client import Mochi
from mochi.auth import Auth

auth = Auth.Token("find api token in mochi settings page")
mochi = Mochi(auth=auth)


# list decks
decks = mochi.decks.list_decks()
print(decks)

if len(decks) < 1:

    # Working with decks
    new_deck = mochi.decks.create_deck(name="My new deck")
    print(new_deck)

# Working with cards
new_card = mochi.cards.create_card("New card content", (decks[0])["id"])
print(new_card)

# Working with templates
templates = mochi.templates.list_templates()
print(templates)

mochi.close()
