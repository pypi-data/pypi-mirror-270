# Sapit - Python Text-to-Speech Module

Sapit is a Python module that enables users to utilize a text-to-speech function similar to the "say" command on macOS. With Sapit, you can easily convert text into speech in your Python scripts or projects.

# Founder

Sapit was created by "ALI LODHI" He is from Pakistan, Ali lodhi is well experienced python programmer who loves writing python code. The Idea of Sapit came when he was making a Desktop Assistant for his personal use and he had to write a lot of code so that's why to ease of use he created sapit. 

## Installation

You can install Sapit using pip:

```bash
pip install sapit
```

## Usage

Using Sapit is simple. Just import the `say` function from the `sapit` module and call it with the text you want to convert into speech:

```python
from sapit import say

say("Hello, World!")
```

This will result in the text "Hello, World!" being spoken aloud using the default system text-to-speech engine.
