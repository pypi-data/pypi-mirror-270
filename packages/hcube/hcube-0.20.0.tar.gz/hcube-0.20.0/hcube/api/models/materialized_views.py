    This is a special type of materialized view that is obtained by removing some of the dimensions
    from a cube and aggregating the metrics for rows that are left the same after the dimensions
    are removed.

    This leads to reduction of the size of the cube.

    To simplify matters, at present the only aggregation supported is SUM() and we do not support
    renaming the metric in the aggregation. This should simplify implementation of automatic
    materialized view detection/use.
