# LPC ML

LPC ML is a tool developed in the CiTIUS, USC by the MODEV group for training a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to optimize and analyze the impact of different design parameters on laser power converters (LPCs) solar cells.

<!-- Data used to feed the neural networks is shared in the following Zenodo Repository [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11032095](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11032095). -->

## Installation
First you need to have installed **pip3** on your system. For Ubuntu, open up a terminal and type:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip

**Instalation of MLFoMpy via pip3**

Install the tool using pip3:

    pip3 install lpcML

and check the library is installed by importing it from a **python3 terminal**:

    import lpcML

Unless an error comes up, LPC ML is now installed on your environment.
