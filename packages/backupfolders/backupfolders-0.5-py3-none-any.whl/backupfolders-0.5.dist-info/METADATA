# Python Backup Script

This Python script performs backups of a specified directory to another location. It can be useful for creating regular backups of important data.

## Features

- **Backup Functionality:** Automatically copies files from a specified directory to a backup folder.
- **Exclude Directories:** Allows excluding specific directories from the backup process.
- **Logging:** Logs the start and completion of each backup operation.

- **MacOs**:
  - `pip3 install backupfolders`.

### Usage
```python
from backupfolders import backupfolders

# source directory
mainPath = r"C:\Users\HP\Desktop\New folder (2)\flappy-bird"

# backup directory
destinationPath = r"D:\Backups"

# exclude folders not to backup
exclude_folders = [] #if any folder needs to be excluded from backup
