:sinebow15:`Outputs`
====================
Omnipose uses a generalized version of the Cellpose U-net to predict several output "images" based on an input image. 
You can use a Cellpose model with Omnipose (``omni=True`` just turns on the Omnipose mask reconstruction algorithm), 
but keep in mind that the output will be different. 

Cellpose models predict 3 (or 4) outputs in 2D (or 3D): 
(flows in Z), flows in Y, flows in X, and cell probability (cellprob). 
The predictions the network makes of cellprob are the inputs to a sigmoid 
centered at zero (1 / (1 + e^-x)), so they vary from around -6 to +6.

Omnipose models predict 4 (or 5) outputs in 2D (or 3D):
(flows in Z), flows in Y, flows in X, distance, and boundary probability.
The distance field has a background of -5 in older models and ``-<mean cell diameter>`` in newer models. This
helps balance the asymmetry in output range, as the flow components range from -5 to +5 and the boundary field 
ranges from roughly -6 to +6 (same sigmoid input described above). 

:header-2:`_seg.npy output`
---------------------------

``*_seg.npy`` files have the following fields:

- *filename* : filename of image
- *img* : image with chosen channels (nchan x Ly x Lx) (if not multiplane)
- *masks* : masks (0 = NO masks; 1,2,... = mask labels)
- *colors* : colors for masks
- *outlines* : outlines of masks (0 = NO outline; 1,2,... = outline labels)
- *chan_choose* : channels that you chose in GUI (0=gray/none, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue)
- *ismanual* : element *k* = whether or not mask *k* was manually drawn or computed by the cellpose algorithm
- *flows* : flows[0] is XY flow in RGB, flows[1] is the cell probability in range 0-255 instead of 0.0 to 1.0, flows[2] is Z flow in range 0-255 (if it exists, otherwise zeros), 
            flows[3] is [dY, dX, cellprob] (or [dZ, dY, dX, cellprob] for 3D), flows[4] is pixel destinations (for internal use)
- *est_diam* : estimated diameter (if run on command line)
- *zdraw* : for each mask, which planes were manually labelled (planes in between manually drawn have interpolated masks)

Here is an example of loading in a ``*_seg.npy`` file and plotting masks and outlines

::

    import numpy as np
    from cellpose import plot
    dat = np.load('_seg.npy', allow_pickle=True).item()

    # plot image with masks overlaid
    mask_RGB = plot.mask_overlay(dat['img'], dat['masks'],
                            colors=np.array(dat['colors']))

    # plot image with outlines overlaid in red
    outlines = plot.outlines_list(dat['masks'])
    plt.imshow(dat['img'])
    for o in outlines:
        plt.plot(o[:,0], o[:,1], color='r')


If you run in a notebook and want to save to a `*_seg.npy` file, run 

::

    from cellpose import io
    io.masks_flows_to_seg(images, masks, flows, diams, file_name, channels)

where each of these inputs is a list (as the output of `model.eval` is)

:header-2:`PNG output`
----------------------

You can save masks to PNG in the GUI. Be aware that the GUI will save the masks in the format being displayed, 
which defaults to the N-color representation for easier visualization and editing (4 or 5 repeating colors). Toggle off ``ncolor`` before 
saving masks to put them in standard 1,...,N format. 

To save masks (and other plots in PNG) using the command line, add the flag ``--save_png``. If you want the N-color versions saved, use ``--save_ncolor``. 

In a notebook, use:

::

    from cellpose import io
    io.save_to_png(images, masks, flows, image_names)

:header-2:`ROI manager compatible output for ImageJ`
----------------------------------------------------

You can save the outlines of masks in a text file that is compatible with ImageJ 
ROI Manager from the GUI File menu.

To save using the command line, add the flag ``--save_txt``.

Use the function below if running in a notebook:

::

    from cellpose import io, plot

    # image_name is file name of image 
    # masks is numpy array of masks for image
    base = os.path.splitext(image_name)[0]
    outlines = utils.outlines_list(masks)
    io.outlines_to_text(base, outlines)
    
To load this ``_cp_outlines.txt`` file into ImageJ, use the python script 
provided in Cellpose: ``imagej_roi_converter.py``. Run this as a macro after 
opening your image file. It will ask you to input the path to the ``_cp_outlines.txt`` 
file. Input that and the ROIs will appear in the ROI manager.

:header-2:`Plotting functions`
------------------------------

In ``plot.py`` there are functions, like ``show_segmentation``:

::

    from cellpose import plot

    nimg = len(imgs)
    for idx in range(nimg):
        maski = masks[idx]
        flowi = flows[idx][0]

        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
        plot.show_segmentation(fig, imgs[idx], maski, flowi, channels=channels[idx])
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()
