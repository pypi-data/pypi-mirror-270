    "This outline view clearly distinguishes cells from each other, and it requires just one color (or channel). As ground truth, binary maps like this are one of the easiest annotations to generate and are therefore quite common in public datasets (see MiSiC, DeLTA, and SuperSegger just for a few in the realm of bacterial microscopy). However, this mode of annotation does not guarantee that shared boundaries between two cells are **precisely** 2px thick. Without this, the resulting label matrix will either exclude boundary pixels or asymmetrically incorporate them into one of the two cells. This is a primary reason why label matrices, not boundary maps, must be the primary / fundamental ground truth used to train and evaluate any segmentation algorithm. \n",

By expanding labels before coloring them (a step that actually takes far longer than the coloring step itself), we get a much more pleasing distribution of colors that can make it easier to assess segmentations when when images are zoomed out.
