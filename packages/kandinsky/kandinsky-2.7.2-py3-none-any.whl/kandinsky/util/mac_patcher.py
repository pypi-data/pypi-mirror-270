"""
Patch the module for MacOS. Redefine some methods of Core and Gui classes.

Since it's the only bone that doesn't accept the method I use to make a GUI,
it will try to patch the module to do a manual refresh.

This means that the program (if launched on this system) will have to regularly
call the display() method to refresh the window.

Basically using the same principle as in the first version of module
(when I was not using Threads yet)

Note: The window to notify the end of script to user, will be not available for mac
