# grrph -- Pascals Python Graph Library 

Currently does nothing but is supposed to collect various useful helpers for loading, transforming, mining, and learning (on) graphs.


## Installation Advice
Many functions in this package require pytorch and pytorch_geometric. However, it is way too complicated to specify this properly in the requirements (for me, as of now).
So please, install pytorch and pytorch_geometric in the versions required for your environment yourself.
