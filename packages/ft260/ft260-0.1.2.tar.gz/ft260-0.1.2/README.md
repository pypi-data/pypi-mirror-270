# PyFT260

Welcome to PyFT260, a Python driver and interface library designed to control and interface with the FTDI FT260 chip, providing access to I2C, UART, and GPIO functionalities. PyFT260 aims to be a drop-in replacement for the smbus2 library (for I2C), offering extended support for the FT260's capabilities.

## Features

- **I2C Interface**: Communicate with I2C devices using the FT260 chip.
- **UART Interface**: Utilize the UART capabilities of the FT260 for serial communication. **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**
- **GPIO Control**: Manage GPIO pins directly through the FT260. **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**
- **Compatibility**: Designed as a drop-in replacement for smbus2, making it easy to switch and get the added benefits of FT260.

## Installation

You can install PyFT260 using pip:
```
  pip3 install pyft260
```
