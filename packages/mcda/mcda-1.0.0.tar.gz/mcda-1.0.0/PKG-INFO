Package for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis named `mcda`.


# Package description

This package is used as a basis to represent Multi-Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) problems as well as solve them.
It also contains relatively low-level plotting functions to visualize a MCDA problem and its solution.

It is released on PyPI as [mcda](https://pypi.org/project/mcda/).

Its documentation is available [here](https://py-mcda.readthedocs.io/).


# Requirements

To be able to plot relations and outranking graphs, this package requires that `graphviz` be installed.
On Debian/Ubuntu this is done with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```


# Installation

If you want to simply use this package, simply install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcda/):

```bash
pip install mcda
```

**Note:**

This package can be installed with different optional dependencies to unlock full features:

* plot: unlock plotting utilities
* all: include all the above optional dependencies

If you want all optional dependencies for instance, do:

```bash
pip install "mcda[all]"
```

Once you installed our package, you can have a look at our [notebooks](https://py-mcda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks.html) section which contains examples on how to use our package.

If you want to contribute to this package development, we recommend you to read the next section.
