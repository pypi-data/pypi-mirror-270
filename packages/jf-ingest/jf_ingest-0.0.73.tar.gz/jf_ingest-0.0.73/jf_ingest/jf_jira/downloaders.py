    Note from Noah 6/28/22 - when using _search_users_by_letter with at least some
    jira server instances, some strange behavior occurs, explained with an example:
    take a case where search_users_by_letter_email_domain is set to '@business.com'
    meaning the query for the letter 'a' will be 'a@business.com'. Jira appears to
    take this query and split it on the punctuation and symbols, e.g [a, business, com].
    It then searches users username, name, and emailAddress for matches, performing the
    same punctuation and symbol split, and looking for matches starting at the beginning
    of each string, e.g. anna@business.com is split into [anna, business, com] and matches,
    but barry@business.com, split into [barry, business, com] will not match. Notably,
    these splits can match multiple substrings, which can lead to large lists of users.
    For example, when searching on the letter c, the full query would be 'c@business.com'
    split into [c, business, com]. This would obviously match cam@business.com, following
    the pattern from before, but unfortunately, the 'c' in the query will match any email
    ending in 'com', so effectively we will download every user. This will occur for
    letters matching every part of the variable search_users_by_letter_email_domain, split
    on punctuation and symbols.
    Notably, this will also happen when search_users_by_letter_email_domain is not set but
    there is still an overlap in the query and email address, e.g. query 'b' would hit all
    users in this hypothetical instance with an '@business.com' email address, since jira
    will split that address and search for strings starting with that query, matching b to business.
    In the future, this domain searching could provide a faster way than searching every
    letter to get all users for instances that have that variable set, but for the time
    being it requires pagination when searching by letter.
