        Parameters
        ----------
        name: str
            Sensor's name.
        vendor: str
            Vendor string of the sensor.
        string_type: str
            A constant string describing the sensor's type.
        power: float
            The power in mA used by this sensor while in use.
        resolution: float
            Resolution of the sensor in the sensor's unit.
        version: int
            Version of the sensor's module.
        type: int
            Generic type of this sensor.
        max_delay: int
            The delay between two sensor events corresponding to the lowest frequency that this sensor supports.
        max_range: int
            Maximum range of the sensor in the sensor's unit.
        min_delay: int
            The minimum delay allowed between two events in microseconds or zero if this sensor only returns a value when the data it's measuring changes.
