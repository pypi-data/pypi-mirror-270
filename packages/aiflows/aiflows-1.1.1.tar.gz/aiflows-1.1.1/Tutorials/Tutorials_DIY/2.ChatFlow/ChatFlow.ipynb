Here, the URL is `aiflows/ChatFlowModule`, where `aiflows` is the name of our organization on Hugging Face (or the username of a user hosting their flow on Hugging Face), and `ChatFlowModule` is the name of the FlowModule containing the `ChatAtomicFlow` on the FlowVerse. Note that the `url` is literally the address of the `ChatFlowModule` on Hugging Face (excluding the https://huggingface.co/). So if you type https://huggingface.co/aiflows/ChatFlowModule in your browser, you will find the Flow.\n",
    "  * `revision`: Represents the revision id (i.e., the full commit hash) of the commit we want to fetch. Note that if you set `revision` to `main`, it will fetch the latest commit on the main branch.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`input_interface_initialized` and `input_interface_non_initialized`**: These parameters in our configuration specify the keys expected in the input data dictionary when the `ChatAtomicFlow` is called for the first time and subsequently. \n",
    "  - `input_interface_non_initialized`: Specifies the keys expected in the input data dictionary when the `ChatAtomicFlow` is called for the first time the flow is called.\n",
    "  - `input_interface_initialized`: Specifies the keys expected in the input data dictionary after the first call, essentially serving a role similar to the regular `input_interface`. \n",
    "The distinction between the two becomes apparent when different inputs are required for the initial query compared to subsequent queries. \n",
    "For instance, in ReAct, the first time you query the LLM, the input is provided by a human, such as a question. In subsequent queries, the input comes from the execution of a tool (e.g., a query to Wikipedia). In ReAct's case, these two scenarios are distinguished by `ChatAtomicFlow`'s `input_interface_non_initialized` and `input_interface_initialized` parameters.\n",

    "    - `model_name`: A dictionary with key-item pairs, where keys correspond to the `backend_used` attribute of the `ApiInfo` class for the chosen backend, and values represent the desired model for that backend. Model selection depends on the provided `api_infos`. Additional models can be added for different backends, following LiteLLM's naming conventions (refer to LiteLLM's supported providers and model names [here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)). For instance, with an Anthropic API key and a desire to use \"claude-2,\" one would check Anthropic's model details [here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#model-details). As \"claude-2\" is named the same in LiteLLM, the `model_name` dictionary would be updated as follows:\n",

    "      backend:\n",
    "      _target_: aiflows.backends.llm_lite.LiteLLMBackend\n",

    "        anthropic: \"claude-2\"\n",
