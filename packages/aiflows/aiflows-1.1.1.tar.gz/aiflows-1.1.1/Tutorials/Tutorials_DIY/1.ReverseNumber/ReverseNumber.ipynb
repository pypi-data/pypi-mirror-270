    "\n",
    "In this section we will introduce the concept of a Flow and implement a simple Flow that reverses a number passed in the input message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, Flows are objects that perform semantically meaningful unit of work and comunicate via messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of Flows: \n",
    "1) **Atomic Flows:** Performs the computation directly\n",
    "2) **Composite Flows:** Orchestrates other Flows in performing the computation\n",
    "\n",
    "When a message is send to a Flow, the Flow processes the message according to the logic specified in its `run` method. We will now go through the implementation of the `ReverseNumberAtomicFlow`: a Flow who given a number, reverses it (e.g., 12345-> 54321).\n",

    "### 1.1 Writing the ReverseNumberAtomicFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a Flow, you must define its run method. This method takes an input_message as its input, which is an instance of the FlowMessage class. Within the FlowMessage, there are two important attributes to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    " - 1. `data`: This attribute is a dictionary containing the data that the Flow will process.\n",
    " - 2. `reply_data`: Another dictionary, it holds necessary information to send a reply message back to the sender of the input message. Typically, direct modification of this attribute isn't recommended. Instead, utilize the provided methods for modifying it (these methods will be introduced throughout the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a Flow, it's crucial to specify the `input_interface` and `output_interface` in the configuration file. These interfaces specify the expected keys in the `data` attribute of the `input_message` and what will be returned in the `data` attribute when sending the message back. This ensures proper calling of your Flow by other users. For instance, in the `ReverseNumberAtomicFlow`, the `input_interface` expects a key `number` in the `data` attribute of the `input_message`, while the `output_interface` will include a key `reversed_number` in the `data` attribute of the sent message. Once the number is reversed, package the response dictionary into a message using the `package_output_message` method. This method packages the dictionary into a message and adjusts the `reply_data` attribute of the message to match that of the input message, ensuring it is sent back to the original sender. Finally, the reply is sent back using the `send_message` method.\n"

    "#### 3.1.2. ReverseNumberSequential with Non-Blocking Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we used blocking calls to the subflows. In this example, we will use non-blocking calls. The description here below explains the differences between blocking and non-blocking calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Blocking vs Non-Blocking Calls**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to call a subflow from a Composite Flow via its proxy:\n",
    "1. **Blocking Calls**: The Composite Flow sends a message to the subflow and waits for the response before proceeding (and therefore stays in the `run` method until the response is received). Blocking calls are made using the `get_reply_future` method we introduced in the previous section (`get_reply_future` return a future object that you can use to retrieve the reply from the Flow via `future.get_data()` or `future.get_message()`, these \"get\" methods are what are blocking).\n",
    "2. **Non-Blocking Calls**: The Composite Flow sends a message to the subflow and proceeds without waiting for the response. The response is expected to be sent in the input message queue of the Composite Flow. Therefore, you must exit the `run` method and the Flow will be called again when the response is received. Non-blocking calls are made using the `send_message` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pros and cons of Blocking vs Non-Blocking Call? \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blocking calls** might be more intuitive to use and understand, but they are less efficient because the Composite Flow is blocked while waiting for the response. Meaning that you are blocking one worker for the duration of the call. Therefore, you must have at least 2 worker threads running to be able to make a blocking call to a subflow and still be able to process other messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-blocking calls** are more efficient because the Composite Flow is not blocked while waiting for the response (one worker can run the whole Flow). However, they are more complex to use because you must manage the state of the Flow and the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the choice between blocking and non-blocking calls depends on the specific use case, the requirements of the Flow and your preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here below we showcase the implementation of the `ReverseNumberSequentialFlow` class with both blocking and non-blocking calls to the `ReverseNumberAtomicFlow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Any data that you must save from one `run` method pass to another must be saved in the `self.flow_state` attribute of the Flow. This attribute is a dictionary that persists between calls to the `run` method. You can use it to save any data you need to keep between calls."
