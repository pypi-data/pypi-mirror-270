They say the owl was a bakerâ€™s daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table.

:::{prf:proof}
:label: full-proof
Let $z$ be any other point in $S$ and use the fact that $S$ is a linear subspace to deduce

```{math}
\| y - z \|^2
= \| (y - \hat y) + (\hat y - z) \|^2
= \| y - \hat y \|^2  + \| \hat y - z  \|^2
```

Hence $\| y - z \| \geq \| y - \hat y \|$, which completes the proof.
