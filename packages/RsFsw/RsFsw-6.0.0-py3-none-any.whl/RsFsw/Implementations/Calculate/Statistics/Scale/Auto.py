		function of the measured spacing between peak power and the minimum power for the APD measurement and of the spacing
		between peak power and mean power for the CCDF measurement. In addition, the probability scale for the number of test
		points is adapted. To get valid results, you have to perform a complete sweep with synchronization to the end of the auto
		range process. This is only possible in single sweep mode. Note this command is not available when using an external
		frontend. \n
