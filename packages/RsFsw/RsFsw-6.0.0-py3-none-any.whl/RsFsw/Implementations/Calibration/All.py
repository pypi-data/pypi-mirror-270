		a self-alignment remotely, then select the 'Local' softkey while the alignment is still running, the instrument only
		returns to the manual operation state after the alignment is completed. In order to recognize when the acquisition of
		correction data is completed, the MAV bit in the status byte can be used. If the associated bit is set in the Service
		Request Enable (SRE) register, the instrument generates a service request after the acquisition of correction data has
		been completed. \n
