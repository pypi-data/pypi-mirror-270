			- A new oscilloscope is connected to the 'IF OUT 2 GHz/ IF OUT 5 GHz' connector of the FSW
			- A new cable is used between the 'IF OUT 2 GHz/ IF OUT 5 GHz' connector of the FSW and the oscilloscope
			- A power splitter is inserted between the 'IF OUT 2 GHz/ IF OUT 5 GHz' connector of the FSW and the oscilloscope
			- New firmware is installed on the oscilloscope or the FSW
		For details see 'Alignment'. \n
