		the method RsFsw.Applications.K17_Mcgd.Display.Window.Size.set command, the method RsFsw.Applications.K17_Mcgd.Layout.
		Splitter.set changes the size of all windows to either side of the splitter permanently, it does not just maximize a
		single window temporarily. Note that windows must have a certain minimum size. If the position you define conflicts with
		the minimum size of any of the affected windows, the command does not work, but does not return an error. \n
			:param index_1: The index of one window the splitter controls.
			:param index_2: The index of a window on the other side of the splitter.
			:param position: New vertical or horizontal position of the splitter as a fraction of the screen area (without channel and status bar and softkey menu) . The point of origin (x = 0, y = 0) is in the lower left corner of the screen. The end point (x = 100, y = 100) is in the upper right corner of the screen. (See Figure 'SmartGrid coordinates for remote control of the splitters'.) The direction in which the splitter is moved depends on the screen layout. If the windows are positioned horizontally, the splitter also moves horizontally. If the windows are positioned vertically, the splitter also moves vertically. Range: 0 to 100
