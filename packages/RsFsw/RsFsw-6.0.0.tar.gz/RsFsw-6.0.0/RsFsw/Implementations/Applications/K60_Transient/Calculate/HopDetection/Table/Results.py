			- Begin: str: char_data relative time (in ms) from the capture start at which the signal first enters the tolerance area of a nominal hop (within the analysis region) Unit: ms
			- Dwell_Time: str: char_data The duration of a hop from begin to end, that is, the time the signal remains in the tolerance area of a nominal hop frequency. Unit: ms
			- Switch_Time: str: char_data The time the signal requires to 'hop' from one level to the next. It is defined as the time between a hop end and the following hop begin. Unit: ms
