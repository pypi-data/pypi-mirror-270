## 👵 Welcome Home!

Runhouse is the fastest way to build, run, and deploy production-quality AI apps and workflows on your own compute.
Leverage simple, powerful APIs for the full lifecycle of AI development, through
research→evaluation→production→updates→scaling→management, and across any infra.

By automatically packaging your apps into scalable, secure, and observable services, Runhouse can also turn
otherwise redundant AI activities into common reusable components across your team or company, which improves
cost, velocity, and reproducibility.

Highlights:
* 👩‍🔬 Dispatch Python functions, classes, and data to remote infra (clusters, cloud VMs, etc.) instantly. No need to
reach for a workflow orchestrator to run different chunks of code on various beefy boxes.
* 👷‍♀️ Deploy Python functions or classes as production-quality services instantly, including HTTPS, auth, observability,
scaling, custom domains, secrets, versioning, and more. No research-to-production gap.
* 🐍 No DSL, decorators, yaml, CLI incantations, or boilerplate. Just your own Python.
* 👩‍🎓 Extensive support for Ray, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure, local, on-prem, and more. When you want to shift or scale,
just send your app to more powerful infra.
* 👩‍🚀 Extreme reusability and portability. A single succinct script can stand up your app, dependencies, and infra.
* 👩‍🍳 Arbitrarily nest applications to create complex workflows and services. Apps are decoupled so you can change,
move, or scale any component without affecting the rest of your system.

The Runhouse API is dead simple. Send your **apps** (functions and classes) into **environments** on compute
**infra**, like this:

```python
import runhouse as rh
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

def sd_generate(prompt, **inference_kwargs):
    model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base").to("cuda")
    return model(prompt, **inference_kwargs).images

if __name__ == "__main__":
    gpu = rh.cluster(name="rh-a10x", instance_type="A10G:1", provider="aws")
    sd_env = rh.env(reqs=["torch", "transformers", "diffusers"], name="sd_generate", working_dir="./")

    # Deploy the function and environment (syncing over local code changes and installing dependencies)
    remote_sd_generate = rh.function(sd_generate).to(gpu, env=sd_env)

    # This call is actually an HTTP request to the app running on the remote server
    imgs = remote_sd_generate("A hot dog made out of matcha.")
    imgs[0].show()

    # You can also call it over HTTP directly, e.g. from other machines or languages
    print(remote_sd_generate.endpoint())
```

With the above simple structure you can run, deploy, and share:
* 🛠️ **AI primitives**: Preprocessing, training, fine-tuning, evaluation, inference
* 🚀 **Higher-order services**: Multi-stage inference (e.g. RAG), e2e workflows
* 🦺 **Controls and safety**: PII obfuscation, content moderation, drift detection
* 📊 **Data services**: ETL, caching, data augmentation, data validation


## 🛋️ Share Apps and Resources with Runhouse Den

You can unlock unique portability and sharing features by creating a
[Runhouse Den account](https://www.run.house/dashboard).
Log in from anywhere to save, share, and load resources:
```shell
runhouse login
```
or from Python:
```python
import runhouse as rh
rh.login()
```

Extending the example above to share and load our app via Den:

```python
remote_sd_generate.share(["my_pal@email.com"])

# The service stub can now be reloaded from anywhere, always at yours and your collaborators' fingertips
# Notice this code doesn't need to change if you update, move, or scale the service
remote_sd_generate = rh.function("/your_username/sd_generate")
imgs = remote_sd_generate("More matcha hotdogs.")
imgs[0].show()
```
